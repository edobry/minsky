# fix(#166): Fix TypeScript errors after removing incompatible @types/commander package

## Summary

Fixed 37 TypeScript errors across 5 files that were exposed after removing the incompatible `@types/commander` package. These errors were preventing successful TypeScript compilation and needed to be resolved to maintain type safety.

## Changes

### Fixed markdownTaskBackend.ts (3 errors)
- Added proper TaskStatus import from domain/tasks/types
- Added type conversions between Task and TaskData interfaces
- Fixed method parameter handling for task operations

### Fixed MCP server logging (3 errors)
- Corrected `log.agent()` calls to use single-argument signature
- Updated logging calls in mcp-server.ts to match expected API

### Fixed MCP fastmcp-server.ts (4 errors)
- Updated configuration to use valid transport properties
- Removed invalid nested `httpStream` properties
- Handled SSE fallback to httpStream transport correctly

### Fixed test utilities assertions (3 errors)
- Added proper type assertions for unknown types
- Updated `expectToHaveLength` and `expectToHaveProperty` functions
- Maintained runtime safety while satisfying TypeScript

### Fixed test compatibility layer (1 error)
- Updated `JestGlobal` interface to match actual implementation
- Fixed signatures for mock, unmock, and getMockFromModule methods

## Testing

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes: `bun run tsc --noEmit` exits with code 0
- ✅ All 37 TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ No new TypeScript errors introduced

## Notes

During comprehensive verification, discovered significant test failures (314 out of 916 tests) that appear to be pre-existing issues unrelated to this TypeScript fix. These have been tracked separately in Task #236 for proper investigation and resolution.
