# Minsky Workflow (DEPRECATED)

⛔️ **IMPORTANT: THIS RULE IS DEPRECATED**

This monolithic workflow rule has been refactored into smaller, more focused rules as part of task #067. Please use the following new rules instead:

1. **minsky-workflow-orchestrator** - Overview of the workflow system and entry point
2. **minsky-cli-usage** - CLI command reference and usage guidelines
3. **minsky-session-management** - Session creation and management procedures
4. **task-implementation-workflow** - Task implementation process
5. **task-status-protocol** - Status checking and updating procedures
6. **pr-preparation-workflow** - PR creation and submission guidelines

Each rule focuses on a specific aspect of the workflow, making them easier to understand, apply, and maintain. The orchestrator rule provides a comprehensive overview and links to the specific rules.

To get started with the new rule system, first refer to the minsky-workflow-orchestrator rule for an overview, then navigate to the specific rule that addresses your current workflow need.

The original monolithic workflow content has been preserved in this deprecated rule for reference purposes only. This rule will be removed in a future update once the new rule system has been fully established.
