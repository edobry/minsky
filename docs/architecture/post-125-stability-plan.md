# Post-CLI Bridge Stability Plan

**Date**: May 23, 2025
**Context**: System stability issues after Task #125 CLI bridge merge
**Status**: ACTIVE DAMAGE CONTROL

---

## Current Situation Assessment

### ✅ What's Working

- **CLI functionality**: End-user CLI commands are functional
- **Core architecture**: CLI bridge successfully generates commands
- **Basic operations**: Help, command discovery, basic execution

### ❌ What's Broken

- **Test infrastructure**: 63 failing tests across multiple modules
- **Session management**: SessionAdapter CRUD operations failing
- **Import resolution**: Multiple "Cannot find module" errors
- **Rules command registration**: Shared command registry issues

### 🔍 Unknown/Investigating

- **Task #129 status**: Major database backend work appears partially implemented
- **Scope of test failures**: Whether they indicate real functionality issues or just test infrastructure problems

---

## Immediate Priorities (Next 48 Hours)

### Priority 1: Critical Import Fixes

**Blocking Issue**: Multiple modules can't resolve imports

```bash
# Known failing imports:
- Cannot find module '../../cli/rules.js'
- Cannot find module '../../../utils/test-utils/assertions.ts'
- Export named 'registerCategorizedCliCommands' not found
```

**Action**: Create task/session to systematically fix import resolution

### Priority 2: Task #129 Status Resolution

**Unknown Factor**: Major database backend changes may be causing test failures

**Actions**:

1. Investigate Task #129 session workspace
2. Determine if it's ready for integration or needs isolation
3. Assess if it conflicts with CLI bridge changes

### Priority 3: Test Infrastructure Stabilization

**Impact**: 63 failing tests prevent reliable development

**Focus Areas**:

- Session management test failures
- Mock system issues
- Test utility module resolution

---

## Parallel Work Strategy

### Track A: System Stability (CRITICAL PATH)

- **Owner**: Immediate assignment needed
- **Scope**: Fix blocking imports and critical test failures
- **Timeline**: 24-48 hours
- **Success Criteria**: Core test suite passes, imports resolve

### Track B: Task #129 Integration (INVESTIGATION)

- **Owner**: Coordinate with Task #129 implementer
- **Scope**: Understand database backend changes and integration needs
- **Timeline**: Parallel to Track A
- **Success Criteria**: Clear understanding of Task #129 status and conflicts

### Track C: Ongoing Work Protection (DEFENSIVE)

- **Owner**: All developers
- **Scope**: Isolate new work from unstable areas
- **Timeline**: Immediate and ongoing
- **Success Criteria**: No new work blocked by current instability

---

## Risk Mitigation

### For New Development

1. **Avoid session management code** until Track A completes
2. **Test CLI commands manually** before relying on automated tests
3. **Use separate sessions** for any new task work
4. **Document workarounds** for known issues

### For Task #129 Work

1. **Don't merge until stability restored**
2. **Coordinate with Track A** to avoid conflicts
3. **Consider rollback strategy** if integration proves problematic

### For CLI Bridge

1. **Monitor for regression reports** from end users
2. **Prepare hotfix strategy** if critical issues discovered
3. **Document known limitations** until test suite stabilized

---

## Success Metrics

### Short Term (48 hours)

- [ ] Import errors resolved
- [ ] Core test suite passing (>90% pass rate)
- [ ] Task #129 status clarified
- [ ] New work can proceed safely

### Medium Term (1 week)

- [ ] Full test suite passing
- [ ] Session management fully functional
- [ ] Task #129 properly integrated or isolated
- [ ] CLI bridge stability confirmed

### Long Term (2 weeks)

- [ ] System more stable than pre-CLI bridge
- [ ] Test infrastructure improved
- [ ] Prevention strategies implemented
- [ ] Documentation updated with lessons learned

---

## Communication Protocol

### Daily Standups

- Report on stability track progress
- Identify any new blocking issues
- Coordinate between parallel tracks

### Escalation Triggers

- New critical functionality breaks
- End-user CLI issues reported
- Task #129 conflicts discovered
- Timeline slippage on critical path

---

## Lessons for Future

### What We Should Have Done

1. **Comprehensive integration testing** before merge
2. **Test suite validation** as merge requirement
3. **Staged rollout** with rollback plan
4. **Better coordination** with parallel work (Task #129)

### Process Improvements

1. **Mandatory test suite pass** before any architectural merge
2. **Integration testing automation** for bridge implementations
3. **Parallel work coordination** protocols
4. **Stability monitoring** post-merge

_This plan will be updated as we learn more about the scope of issues and Task #129 status._
