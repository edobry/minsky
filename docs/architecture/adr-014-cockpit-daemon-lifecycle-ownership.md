# ADR-014: Cockpit Daemon Lifecycle Ownership — Tray App as Canonical Supervisor, launchd as Optional Headless Mode

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The cockpit daemon (`minsky cockpit start`, an HTTP server on `:3737`) and the cockpit
**tray app** (`cockpit-tray/`, a macOS menu-bar app) currently have a split, ambiguous
ownership model for the daemon's lifecycle:

- The tray app's Start/Stop/Restart menu items shell out to `launchctl load/unload`
  against `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.minsky.cockpit.plist` (`cockpit-tray/src-tauri/src/main.rs`).
- The plist is installed by `minsky cockpit install` (`src/cockpit/launchd.ts`).
- In practice the daemon is frequently run **manually** for development:
  `bun --watch run src/cli.ts cockpit start --dev` — a foreground process the launchd
  agent knows nothing about.

So there are up to **three** putative owners (launchd, the manual dev process, the tray
app's launchctl calls) and no single source of truth. The originating incident
(mt#2240 / mt#2241, 2026-06-01): the launchd agent was not loaded, the real daemon was the
manual `bun --watch` process, and the tray's Start/Stop/Restart therefore operated on a
non-running launchd agent and silently no-op'd — the daemon "kept running fine in the
browser" while the controls did nothing.

**What launchd actually provides here.** The plist (`src/cockpit/launchd.ts → generatePlist`)
declares only three substantive behaviors, and it is a per-user **LaunchAgent** (login-scoped,
not a privileged system daemon):

1. `RunAtLoad` — start the daemon at login.
2. `KeepAlive { SuccessfulExit: false }` + `ThrottleInterval: 5` — restart on crash (non-zero
   exit), throttled to once per 5s.
3. `StandardOutPath` / `StandardErrorPath` — redirect logs to files.

Each is replicable by a menu-bar app: login-item registration replaces `RunAtLoad`; a
supervision loop replaces `KeepAlive`; piping the child's stdio to log files replaces the log
redirection. The tray app already spawns subprocesses (it shells `launchctl` via `Command`),
so owning the daemon as a managed child is _less_ indirection, not more. This is the standard
pattern for menu-bar daemon managers (Ollama, Docker Desktop's helper, etc.).

**Alternatives considered:**

- **(a) launchd-only (status quo).** Rejected — it is the source of the split-ownership bug.
  The tray controls a lifecycle (launchd) that is not the one actually running in dev, and
  the app has no direct knowledge of the daemon it purports to control.
- **(b) App as sole owner, retire launchd entirely.** Rejected — it removes the ability to run
  the daemon headless (no menu-bar app), which is useful for non-GUI contexts (a server, CI,
  or an unattended box).
- **(c) App owns by default, launchd retained as an optional headless mode.** Chosen.

### Relation to existing documentation

This ADR is **forward-looking**. The current implementation still matches the older behavior
described in `docs/architecture/cockpit.md` ("Daemon mode (mt#2140)") — launchd as the primary
managed path and the tray app as a `launchctl` controller. That remains accurate until
mt#2241 lands the supervisor model. When mt#2241 ships, `docs/architecture/cockpit.md` is
updated to point at this ADR as the lifecycle source of truth.

## Decision

We will make the **cockpit tray app the canonical owner and supervisor of the cockpit
daemon.** The app:

- **Spawns** the daemon as a managed child process on launch.
- **Supervises** it: detects unexpected exit and respawns with a throttle (replicating
  `KeepAlive` + `ThrottleInterval`), and pipes the child's stdout/stderr to the cockpit log
  files.
- **Adopts** an already-running daemon: on launch, if `:3737` is already served (e.g. a manual
  `bun --watch` dev run, or a stale process), the app monitors that daemon via the health
  endpoint instead of double-spawning. Start/Stop/Restart then act on the actual running
  daemon, whatever started it.
- **Tears down** the daemon it spawned on Quit.
- **Auto-starts** by registering itself as a macOS Login Item (replacing `RunAtLoad`).

We will **retain launchd (`minsky cockpit install`) as an optional, explicitly opt-in headless
mode** for running the daemon without the menu-bar app. The two paths coordinate on a single
invariant: **one daemon owns `:3737` at a time.** The tray app must detect an existing
listener (launchd-managed or otherwise) and adopt-or-defer rather than spawn a competitor; the
launchd path remains a deliberate choice for headless contexts, not the default.

## Consequences

**Easier:**

- A single canonical owner removes the split-ownership ambiguity that caused mt#2240/mt#2241.
  Start/Stop/Restart act on the daemon that is actually running.
- Status becomes direct and reliable: the app knows its child's state from the process handle
  (not solely an HTTP poll), with the health poll as the fallback for adopted/external daemons.
- The control surface (the menu) and the supervisor are the same component — coherent, and the
  common pattern for this class of app.
- Local/dev use needs no `minsky cockpit install` step; launching the app is sufficient.

**Harder / newly committed:**

- The app must implement supervision (respawn-on-crash + throttle), child stdio→log
  redirection, login-item registration, and clean teardown — logic that launchd provided
  declaratively.
- **Two lifecycle paths must not fight over `:3737`.** The app and the optional launchd mode
  both have to honor the single-owner invariant; the app must detect-and-adopt an existing
  listener. This coordination is the main new correctness surface.
- The daemon's lifetime is bound to the app under the default path (no app running → no
  daemon). For a login-item menu-bar app this is effectively the prior "always on," and the
  optional launchd headless mode covers the genuine no-GUI case.
- Pre-login/boot start is not provided by either path (the launchd entry is a LaunchAgent, not
  a system LaunchDaemon) — unchanged from today; out of scope.

## Implementation notes and risks (non-normative)

These are guidance for the mt#2241 implementation, not part of the decision:

- **Adoption detection.** Prefer attempting the daemon's own bind and treating an
  `EADDRINUSE` on `:3737` as "a daemon (or something) already owns the port", combined with a
  health probe (`GET /api/health`) to confirm it is _our_ daemon before adopting. Bind-failure
  alone proves the port is taken; the health probe disambiguates our daemon from an unrelated
  listener.
- **TOCTOU race.** There is a time-of-check/time-of-use gap between "probe says nothing is on
  `:3737`" and "we spawn". Two app instances (or app + launchd headless) launching
  concurrently could both decide to spawn. Mitigate by making the daemon's own startup bind
  authoritative (the loser gets `EADDRINUSE` and the app falls back to adopt), rather than
  relying on the pre-spawn probe as a lock. A user-level lockfile or single-instance guard on
  the app is a secondary defense.
- **Adopted vs spawned status source.** For a daemon the app spawned, derive status from the
  child process handle (plus health poll). For an adopted/external daemon, fall back to the
  health poll. Either way the poll must use a fresh connection per check (see mt#2225).
- **launchd coexistence.** The optional headless launchd mode and the app must honor the
  single-owner-of-`:3737` invariant: whichever binds first wins; the other adopts or defers.
  Running both in "spawn" mode simultaneously is the misconfiguration to guard against.
