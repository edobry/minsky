# Cockpit

Operator-facing mission-control web app for Minsky. Local-only v0 (`minsky cockpit`); web-primary, no TUI investment. Architecture is shell + widget framework — each widget is a self-contained module declaring its data dependencies, shipping independently, degrading gracefully when dependencies aren't ready.

Parent task: mt#1143. Engineering bundle: mt#1768.

## Shell

The app shell (mt#2397/mt#2398) is a persistent left **rail** (attention digest pinned at
top → workstream spine → browse entity entry points; replaces the former hamburger/NavSheet
overlay) beside a **tabbed workspace**: list pages navigate the main pane, while entity
details (a task at `/tasks/:id`, a conversation at `/conversation/:id`, a workspace at
`/agents/:id`) open as URL-driven tabs in a
working-set strip (`TabBar`, hidden when empty; state in localStorage). The ⌘K command
palette is mounted globally.

Two id-spaces (mt#2398/mt#2420/mt#1919 — do not conflate; vocabulary per ADR-022 stage 1,
mt#2686): `/agents` and `/agents/:id` are keyed by the **Minsky workspace sessionId**
(`SessionRecord`); `/conversations` and `/conversation/:id` are keyed by the **harness
agentSessionId** (ingested transcript). The workspace detail page bridges the two — when the
workspace directory resolves to an ingested transcript's cwd, it links to the conversation at
`/conversation/:agentSessionId` (served by `GET /api/agents/:id`). (`/agents` and `/agents/:id`
keep their existing names — the Agents list/detail pair is a separate naming decision, out of
scope for the ADR-022 rename.)

## Widgets

Each widget declares an `id` matching `WidgetModule.id` in its backend module under
`src/cockpit/widgets/`, registered in `src/cockpit/widget-registry.ts`. **Registering a
widget is sufficient** — its data endpoint (`/api/widget/<id>/data`) is served whenever the
widget is in the registry. There is no per-widget enable flag and no `cockpit.json` config
file (both removed in mt#2294); widgets auto-work on first run with no manual config edit.

The model separates two concerns the old `enabled` flag conflated:

- **Capability** — "does this widget's data endpoint work" — is owned by the registry. A
  registered widget always serves; an `id` not in the registry returns `HTTP 404
"Widget not found"`; a registered widget whose backend is unavailable returns its
  graceful-degraded payload (`{ state: "degraded", reason }`) rather than a 404.
- **Layout** — "which cards the home System-status grid renders" — is decided on the
  frontend (`src/cockpit/web/App.tsx`), from the registry plus the renderer maps; it is
  not operator-configurable today.

Any future cockpit configuration (e.g. polling intervals) lives under a `cockpit` tree in
the main Minsky config (`~/.config/minsky/config.yaml`), not a separate file.

### Query-layer-failure vs no-data convention (mt#2758)

`WidgetData`'s `{ state: "ok" | "degraded" }` split is all-or-nothing per widget — it signals
that the WHOLE widget failed, not that one of several independent data sources inside an `ok`
payload silently failed. Widgets that fan out to multiple independent sources (several DB
queries, several HTTP probes) commonly degrade each source independently — a failing query
`catch`es to an empty default (`[]`/`null`/`0`) so one bad source doesn't take the rest of the
widget down. That per-source fail-open creates a structural blind spot: a source that failed
and a source that legitimately has no data both resolve to the same empty value, so "the query
layer is broken" and "there's genuinely nothing here yet" render identically. This is exactly
what happened to the reviewer-bot-status widget for ~5 weeks (mt#2076/mt#2757) — every DB query
threw `NOT_TAGGED_CALL` while the UI showed healthy-looking zeros, and nobody could tell from
the cockpit.

**Convention:** a widget with this shape adds ADDITIVE OPTIONAL fields to its own payload
(payload is `unknown` at the `WidgetData` level, so no framework change is needed) signaling
per-fetch-cycle failure counts alongside the real data. The reference implementation
(`src/cockpit/widgets/reviewer-bot-status.ts`) adds `queryFailureCount` / `queryTotalCount` to
its `db` sub-object: `queryFailureCount` counts how many of the widget's independent queries
failed to run for real (threw, rejected, or had no live connection) during the CURRENT fetch
cycle, and `queryTotalCount` is the denominator. The counter is computed as state local to the
fetch invocation (not module-level) — a widget that single-flights concurrent `fetch()` calls
(reviewer-bot-status does, mt#2765) would otherwise leak or double-count the failure signal
across polling cycles. A `degradedFields: string[]` naming the specific affected output fields
is an equally valid shape when per-field granularity is more useful than a count.

**Frontend rendering:** render a visible degraded indicator when the failure count is nonzero
— never let it fall through to the same rendering as "no data." `ReviewerBotStatus.tsx` renders
an `AnomalyBanner` when `db.queryFailureCount > 0`: the amber warning variant for a partial
failure, the `destructive` semantic token (per `src/cockpit/CLAUDE.md`'s error-state convention)
when every query in the cycle failed.

This is a reference-implementation convention adopted incrementally, not a framework
requirement — see the full type-level writeup in `src/cockpit/types.ts` above `WidgetData`.
Existing widgets are not required to adopt it in one pass; new widgets with a multi-source
fan-out shape should.

### Widget parameterization (slice/altitude)

Widgets are slice-parameterizable (mt#2385, Constraint-2 of the mt#2373 widget-contract
refactor): the data endpoint forwards URL query params into the widget's
`fetch({ id, query })` call (`WidgetContext.query`), so the SAME widget can return
different subsets/aggregations of its state space per request. On the frontend, params are
passed via `fetchWidgetData(id, params)` and carried in the TanStack Query key, so two
instances at different params cache independently — an instance is `(widgetId, params)`
materialized at the render site. A registry-level `WidgetInstance` abstraction is
deliberately deferred until the lens engine (mt#2372) needs declarative instance lists.

**Workstreams is the reference case.** `GET /api/widget/workstreams/data?altitude=<slice>`
selects one of three semantic slices (unknown/absent values fall back to `full`; the
applied slice is echoed in the payload as `altitude`):

| Altitude     | Slice                                                                                                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `full`       | Default — the complete card view (parents + all children)                                                           |
| `rollup`     | Outcome rollup: card headers + counts only, no child rows                                                           |
| `actionable` | Actionable-now: children narrowed to IN-PROGRESS / IN-REVIEW / READY / BLOCKED; workstreams without one are dropped |

The `/workstreams` page reads `?altitude=` from the URL and renders a
Full / Rollup / Actionable toggle. Slice names are **semantic, not persona-named** —
lenses (user-definable modes that compose and parameterize widgets) are owned by mt#2372
and must not be hardcoded into widget vocabularies.

**Anomaly semantics (A1–A4):**

| Code                     | Trigger                                                     | Severity |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| A1 — Service unreachable | `/health` probe returned non-200 or timed out (5 s timeout) | Error    |
| A2 — Stale in-flight     | >= 1 review acquired more than 10 min ago                   | Warning  |
| A3 — Failure-rate spike  | > 50% failure rate AND sample >= 5 events in the last 24 h  | Error    |
| A4 — Latency regression  | P95 latency > 120 s in the last 24 h                        | Warning  |

**DB access:** reads four reviewer tables directly via the shared Postgres connection (`getSharedPersistenceService`). The widget degrades gracefully — DB fields become `null` when the DB is unreachable (A1–A4 continue to be computable from the `/health` probe alone). Individual SQL query failures degrade only the affected field(s); the `db` object is still non-null when only some queries fail (e.g. `PERCENTILE_CONT` unsupported on a PG variant causes `avgLatencyMs`/`p95LatencyMs` to be null while all other fields remain populated).

**Query-layer-failure signal (mt#2758):** `db.queryFailureCount` / `db.queryTotalCount` (15 queries per fetch cycle) distinguish "a query failed" from "a query legitimately returned zero rows" — both previously rendered as indistinguishable zeros. The frontend renders an `AnomalyBanner` whenever `queryFailureCount > 0` (amber for partial, `destructive` for every query in the cycle failing). See "Query-layer-failure vs no-data convention" above for the general pattern this widget is the reference implementation of.

**Health endpoint override:** set `MINSKY_REVIEWER_HEALTH_URL` to point at a different host. Default: `https://minsky-reviewer-webhook-production.up.railway.app/health` (the Railway public domain for the `minsky-reviewer-webhook` service).

**Polling interval:** 30 s (backend) / 30 s (frontend TanStack Query `refetchInterval`).

## Ask advancement sweep (mt#2265)

The cockpit daemon runs the **ask advancement sweep**: one pass at boot, then
every 60s (`startAskAdvancementSweeper` in `src/cockpit/sweepers.ts`, domain
logic in `packages/domain/src/ask/advancement.ts`). The sweep advances
`detected` asks that nothing else routed — emission-callsite rows, rows from
crashed processes — and expires stale ones (`detected` older than 7 days;
ephemeral authorization/review requests whose moment has passed).
**`direction.decide` asks are exempt from staleness expiry everywhere** —
they are durable principal decisions, so a stale one is routed to the
operator surface (where it can be declined) rather than silently expired;
the triage script likewise never bulk-expires them. Per-kind
coverage: operator-bound asks (inbox / elicitation-fallback) land `suspended`
and appear on `/asks`; policy-covered asks close with the citation;
subagent/mesh/retriever asks persist as `routed` awaiting a delivery loop
(mt#1570 family). `createAsk` itself persists its route outcome at create
(the sweep is the recovery backstop, not the primary path). Observability:
asks count-by-state on `debug_systemInfo` (`asks` field) — a growing
`detected` count means the advancement path is not running. One-time backlog
triage: `bun scripts/asks-backlog-triage.ts` (dry-run by default,
`--execute` to expire the stale set; `direction.decide` asks are never
bulk-expired).

## Transcript watcher (mt#2320)

The cockpit daemon runs the **transcript watcher** — the primary transcript-capture
mechanism of ADR-017. It attaches a recursive `fs.watch` over
`~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` (`startTranscriptWatcher` in
`src/cockpit/transcript-watcher.ts`) and, on append, ingests the changed
session's new turns through the existing idempotent
`AgentTranscriptIngestService` (via a `SingleFileTranscriptSource` so a single
file ingest is O(1), not a full project scan). An in-flight session therefore
becomes FTS-searchable shortly after its turns hit disk — no session exit, no
manual `transcripts ingest`, no MCP reboot. Existing transcripts are seeded at
start with their tailer offset at EOF (history is owned by the boot sweep,
mt#2051); only post-attach appends are tailed. The shared incremental-read
primitive is `JsonlTailer` (`packages/domain/src/transcripts/jsonl-tailer.ts`),
reused by the Rung-1 live renderer (mt#2232). Ingest dedup is owned by the
service's timestamp high-water-mark, so a missed/dropped FS event is recovered
by the periodic sweep backstop (mt#2321); the watcher fails open (an
unsupported recursive watch logs and no-ops).

**Observability — `GET /api/health` `transcriptWatcher`.** Because the watcher
runs in the cockpit process (unlike `debug_systemInfo`, which is the MCP-server
process), its health is exposed on the cockpit's own `/api/health` endpoint
under a `transcriptWatcher` object:

```jsonc
"transcriptWatcher": {
  "running": true,
  "filesWatched": 12,
  "ingestsTriggered": 34,
  "ingestsSucceeded": 33,
  "ingestErrors": 1,
  "turnsIngested": 410,
  "lastIngestAt": "2026-06-18T20:00:00.000Z",
  "lastErrorAt": "2026-06-18T19:58:00.000Z",
  "activeSessions": [
    {
      "agentSessionId": "abc-123",
      "isSubagent": false,
      "lastEventAt": "2026-06-18T20:00:00.000Z",
      "lastIngestAt": "2026-06-18T20:00:00.000Z",
      "lastTurnsIngested": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

**Security posture.** `/api/health` is unauthenticated, so the payload is
deliberately redacted: it carries **no absolute filesystem paths** (the
`agentSessionId` — the JSONL filename stem — is the only session identifier;
the absolute `jsonlPath` is never exposed) and **no raw error-message strings**
(only an `ingestErrors` count and `lastErrorAt` timestamp; the underlying error
text is emitted to the daemon log surface, not the API). Adding a field here
that could leak a path or internal detail re-opens that disclosure — keep the
redaction when extending it.

**Watchdog fields (mt#2578).** The tray-app supervisor's self-health watchdog
(ADR-014 lifecycle extension) reads two additional top-level fields from
`/api/health` to detect daemon restarts and sustained DB degradation:

| Field                 | Type                   | Semantics                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `processStartedAtMs`  | `number` (epoch-ms)    | Timestamp when this daemon process started. The tray supervisor compares it across polls; a value change means the daemon restarted (used to detect adopted-daemon restarts not caused by a supervised child exit).             |
| `consecutiveDegraded` | `number` (integer ≥ 0) | Number of consecutive health polls where the DB status was not `"ok"`. The tray uses this as a cross-check; it also maintains its own DB-degraded counter for alert gating. Reset to `0` on the first poll where `db === "ok"`. |

**Redaction note:** both fields are non-sensitive — `processStartedAtMs` is an
epoch-ms integer with no path or identity information; `consecutiveDegraded` is
a small counter. Neither violates the endpoint's unauthenticated-access posture.

## Transcript sweep backstop (mt#2321)

The cockpit daemon also runs the **transcript sweep backstop** — the recovery
layer behind the watcher (mt#2320), per ADR-017's watcher-primary +
sweep-backstop design. On a configurable cadence (`startTranscriptSweepBackstop`
in `src/cockpit/sweepers.ts`) it runs a full-discovery `ingestAll()` (idempotent /
HWM-gated) followed by the vector-only semantic-embedding backfill
(`index-embeddings`), run off the critical path and fail-open — a missing or
failing embedding provider does not crash the sweep. It recovers what the watcher
can miss: dropped/coalesced FS events, sessions that completed while the daemon
was down, sessions predating the watcher's attach, and stale/missing embeddings.

**Cadence.** Default 30 minutes (heavier than the prod-state sweeper because a
full `ingestAll` re-discovers every session). Externally configurable via the
`MINSKY_TRANSCRIPT_SWEEP_INTERVAL_MS` env var (positive-integer milliseconds;
invalid values fall back to the default with a warning).

**Observability — `GET /api/health` `transcriptSweep`.** Like the watcher, the
sweep runs in the cockpit process, so its health is on the cockpit's own
`/api/health` — NOT `debug_systemInfo`, which runs in the MCP-server process and
would read zero for cockpit-process state:

```jsonc
"transcriptSweep": {
  "sweepsRun": 3,
  "sessionsIngested": 41,
  "sessionsErrored": 0,
  "embedRuns": 3,
  "lastSweepAt": "2026-06-19T22:00:00.000Z",
  "lastErrorAt": null
}
```

Same redaction posture as the watcher: counts + ISO timestamps only — no
absolute paths, no raw error-message strings (the unauthenticated-endpoint
disclosure constraint).

## Slow-clock topology sweeper (mt#2602)

The cockpit daemon runs the **slow-clock topology sweeper**
(`startTopologySweeper` in `src/cockpit/sweepers.ts`): one pass at boot, then
hourly, mirroring `startProdStateRefreshSweeper`'s producer/consumer split
(mt#2506). Each pass:

1. Resolves the repo root (`findRepoRoot`, `web-dist.ts`) and lists
   `.claude/hooks/` and `.minsky/hooks/` (both, deduped — the mt#2304
   compile-pipeline migration may be pre-merge, mid-flight, or complete).
2. Runs a single bounded, read-only `git log --reverse --diff-filter=A
--name-only -- .claude/hooks .minsky/hooks` (10s timeout, 4MB max-buffer)
   to find each hook file's original install commit — pure derivation logic
   in `src/cockpit/topology-derivation.ts`, impure I/O in
   `src/cockpit/topology-cache.ts`.
3. Queries `retrospective.fired` system events (mt#2537) and correlates them
   to install commits by task ref (exact) or time proximity (nearest
   preceding, within 14 days).
4. Writes the result to an in-process cache; the `slow-topology` widget's
   `fetch()` only ever reads this cache — no per-request git subprocess or
   DB query.

Fail-open at every step: a missing repo root, unreadable hook dirs, a failed
git subprocess, or an unreachable DB each degrade to honest `null`/`unknown`
fields (or, for a total failure, leave the last-good cache in place) rather
than fabricating data. The widget payload's `status` field distinguishes
`"pending"` (no successful sweep yet) from `"ready"`.

## Operator dev loop

Dev mode (recommended for active UI work):

```bash
minsky cockpit start --dev --port 3737
```

Starts Express API + Vite dev middleware on a single port. Frontend changes hot-reload via Vite HMR; API routes are served by Express as normal. For server-side auto-restart, wrap with `bun --watch`:

```bash
bun --watch run src/cli.ts cockpit start --dev --port 3737
```

Production mode (pre-built bundle):

```bash
bun run cockpit:build && minsky cockpit start --port 3737
```

When the daemon is run via the **cockpit tray** (the canonical supervisor, ADR-014), this `cockpit:build` step is automatic: the tray rebuilds the bundle at startup if source is newer than `dist/`, and watches `src/cockpit/web/**` for changes while running (mt#2297). Operators running through the tray never need to invoke `cockpit:build` by hand. The auto-rebuild is gated on a source checkout being present — a packaged/no-source install serves the bundle shipped with the app.

## Bind, auth, and CSP posture (mt#2538)

The daemon binds `127.0.0.1` (loopback) by default (`src/commands/cockpit/start-command.ts`).
An explicit `--host <host>` opt-in is required to bind any other interface; doing so logs a
one-line warning naming the exposure (cockpit data — tasks, sessions, transcripts, live events —
plus the command surface become reachable from that interface, e.g. the whole LAN for a bare IP
or `0.0.0.0`).

**Loopback bind alone is not a sufficient auth posture.** Any local process of any user on the
machine can reach loopback, DNS-rebinding can drive a victim browser at `localhost`, and the Rung
2A driven-session WS channel (mt#2750) needs a token model regardless. So the daemon also enforces:

- **Bearer token** (`src/cockpit/auth.ts`) — a random token generated on first boot and persisted
  at `~/.local/state/minsky/cockpit-token` (mode `0600`), reused across restarts. Every
  non-GET/HEAD/OPTIONS request must carry it, either as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` or via the
  `minsky_cockpit` cookie (`HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`, no `Secure` — the daemon is plain HTTP on
  loopback). The cookie is minted automatically on the first GET, so the SPA's same-origin
  mutation fetches work with zero URL/localStorage plumbing. A `?token=<t>` query-param bootstrap
  is also accepted on any GET (validates, sets the cookie, redirects to strip the param) for a
  future non-loopback opt-in consumer.
- **Read-only GET/SSE surfaces are exempt from the token check.** The loopback bind already
  restricts them to the local machine, and plumbing the token to every GET consumer (the tray
  Rust supervisor's `/api/health` poll, the chrome-devtools-mcp dev canary, curl operators) is
  disproportionate at this tier. The Rung 2A WS channel (mt#2750, see below) DOES require the
  token — it is remote command execution, not a read-only surface.
- **Host-header allowlist** (DNS-rebinding defense) — every request's `Host` header must resolve
  to `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, or the configured `--host` value; anything else gets `403`.
  This is what stops an attacker-controlled DNS name that resolves to `127.0.0.1` from reaching
  the daemon under its own `Host` value.
- **Content-Security-Policy** — set on every GET/HEAD response (`src/cockpit/csp.ts`):
  `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:;
connect-src 'self' ws: wss:; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'`. `--dev` mode (Vite HMR) uses a
  relaxed variant (`'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'` on `script-src`) since Vite's dev client and
  esbuild's dev transform rely on inline/eval'd script execution the pre-built prod bundle never
  needs.
- **No permissive CORS.** There is no `cors` middleware and no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
  response header anywhere in `server.ts` — that absence IS the policy (same-origin only). A
  cross-origin mutation additionally fails an explicit `Origin` check as defense in depth for
  non-browser HTTP clients that set `Origin` manually (browsers already can't get a cross-origin
  `fetch()` to succeed here, and the `SameSite=Strict` cookie is never sent cross-site regardless).

Scope: this posture covers the **local** cockpit daemon only. The Railway-deployed
`services/cockpit/src/server.ts` is a separate entrypoint that binds `0.0.0.0` deliberately for
the platform proxy and is out of scope here. Because both entrypoints share the same
`createCockpitServer()` factory, the Railway entrypoint passes `isPublicDeployment: true`
(`CockpitServerOptions`), which skips the Host-header allowlist and the bearer-token/cookie
mutation-auth for that deployment — its incoming `Host` header is a Railway-assigned public
hostname that could never satisfy the loopback-only allowlist, and introducing a mutation
bearer-token requirement to an already-shipped multi-consumer production surface is out of
scope for this task. The CSP header and the no-CORS policy are additive/response-only, so they
still apply to the Railway deployment too. The Rung 3 cloud→local relay channel (mt#2238) owns
its own, distinct auth surface for that separate concern.

## Driven-session host and WS channel (Rung 2A, mt#2750)

`src/cockpit/driven-session-host.ts` spawns the **genuine `claude` binary**
as a managed child of the LOCAL cockpit daemon (never the Railway
`isPublicDeployment` entrypoint — see the Bind/auth section above):

```
claude -p --input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json \
  --verbose --include-partial-messages [--dangerously-skip-permissions]
```

cwd set to the target workspace. Stdout is parsed defensively as
newline-delimited stream-json events (the upstream event schema is thin —
anthropics/claude-code#24594 / #24596). A daemon-side
`DrivenSessionRegistry` tracks each spawned session — keyed by a spawn-time
local id (used by the WS route, addressable before the child's `init` event
can possibly arrive) with the harness `init` session id recorded as a
secondary index once observed.

Endpoints (`src/cockpit/routes/driven-sessions.ts`, mounted only when
`!isPublicDeployment`):

| Path                           | Method | Purpose                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/driven-session`          | POST   | Spawn a driven session; returns its local id  |
| `/api/driven-session/:id/stop` | POST   | Graceful stop (close stdin, SIGTERM fallback) |
| `/api/driven-session`          | GET    | List app-started sessions (registry snapshot) |
| `/api/driven-session/:id/ws`   | WS     | Bidirectional event/input channel (below)     |

The WS channel (`src/cockpit/driven-session-ws.ts`) attaches to the
daemon's underlying `http.Server` `"upgrade"` event via the `ws` package
(`{ noServer: true }` + `wss.handleUpgrade`) — WS upgrades bypass Express's
request pipeline entirely, so this is a separate attach point wired from
`src/commands/cockpit/start-command.ts` rather than mounted on the Express
app. It replays the session's buffered event log on connect, streams new
events live, and forwards client frames to the child's stdin as stream-json
user-message turns (multi-turn — the child process stays alive across
turns). Every upgrade is validated against the SAME mt#2538 bearer
token/cookie and Host allowlist the mutation-auth middleware enforces
(`isValidCockpitAuth`/`isHostAllowed`, shared, not reinvented) — an
unauthenticated or disallowed-Host upgrade never completes the handshake.

Permission posture is an explicit, logged parameter
(`bypassPermissions` | `default`; default `bypassPermissions` —
`--dangerously-skip-permissions`, since Rung 2A ships no permission-prompt
UI). If an org policy blocks that flag, the child exits immediately and the
host surfaces a readable `minsky_error`/`minsky_exit` event on the channel
rather than hanging.

Nested-scope note: the spawned `claude` child inherits the operator's MCP
config and may call back into Minsky MCP tools mid-turn. The cockpit daemon
and the Minsky MCP server are separate OS processes reached over
stdio/HTTP by the child — there is no in-process loop; a `tool_use`/
`tool_result` pair is just another pair of forwarded events to this host.

Out of scope for Rung 2A (deferred to later rungs): SPA rendering of the
channel (Rung 2B), launch-from-task UX (Rung 2C), cost readout (Rung 2D),
a raw PTY/xterm.js terminal view, and the cloud relay (Rung 3, mt#2238).

## Daemon lifecycle and tray

- `cockpit-tray/` — Tauri v2 menu bar app
- [ADR-014](adr-014-cockpit-daemon-lifecycle-ownership.md) — daemon lifecycle ownership (tray-app supervisor; mt#2241)
- Bundle auto-rebuild (mt#2297): the tray keeps the served production bundle fresh — a startup pre-flight rebuild (when `src/cockpit/web/**` is newer than `dist/`) plus a runtime filesystem watcher that rebuilds on source changes (excluding `dist`/`node_modules`/`.git`). A "Last build" line in the tray menu shows when the bundle last refreshed; build failures surface there (serving the prior bundle on a runtime failure, refusing to spawn when there is no bundle at all). All of it no-ops on a no-source install. See `cockpit-tray/README.md` § _Bundle auto-rebuild_.
- Backend auto-restart (mt#2299): the **server-side** complement to the bundle rebuild. The widget registry and route table load at process start, so when backend source (`src/cockpit/server.ts`, `widget-registry.ts`, `widgets/**`, `config.ts`, `types.ts`) changes, the running daemon is stale (new widgets return `Widget not found`) until it restarts. The daemon spawns from source (`bun run src/cli.ts`), so a plain process restart picks up backend changes with no build step. The tray (a) restarts an **adopted** daemon at startup if backend source is newer than the daemon's start time (the originating 2026-06-04 8-day-stale case), and (b) watches `src/cockpit/**` (excluding `web/**`, which the mt#2297 rebuild path owns) and restarts the daemon on a debounced backend change. A "Daemon uptime" line shows how long the daemon has run + the source mtime it was started against, so operators can confirm currency at a glance; a crash-loop on restart (e.g. a syntax error) surfaces the stderr tail in the status line instead of a silent "stopped". Operators never need to manually `kill <pid>` or know that backend changes require a restart (caveat: restart/stop of an _adopted_ daemon depends on `lsof`/`ps` availability + a killable holder; otherwise the tray surfaces the conflict message rather than killing a foreign listener). All of it no-ops on a no-source install. See `cockpit-tray/README.md` § _Backend auto-restart_.
