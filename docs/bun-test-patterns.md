# ⚠️ DEPRECATED: Use .cursor/rules/bun-test-patterns.mdc Instead

**This file has been deprecated in favor of the comprehensive rule file.**

## 🔗 Current Documentation Location

**For ALL Bun test patterns, please see:**
**[.cursor/rules/bun-test-patterns.mdc](../.cursor/rules/bun-test-patterns.mdc)**

The .mdc file is now the **single source of truth** and contains:

✅ **All content from this file**  
✅ **Plus proven success patterns achieving 100% test success rate**  
✅ **Critical Test Architecture Protocol**  
✅ **Cross-test interference prevention**  
✅ **Root cause investigation methodology**  
✅ **Complete ESLint integration guide**  
✅ **Debugging and troubleshooting sections**  

## Why This Change?

- **Single Source of Truth**: Eliminates duplication between .md and .mdc versions
- **AI Agent Rules**: The .mdc file serves as both documentation and AI behavioral rules
- **Proven Patterns**: Contains all the patterns that achieved 100% test success
- **Comprehensive**: More complete coverage of testing architecture

## Migration Guide

- **Developers**: Use `.cursor/rules/bun-test-patterns.mdc` for all test pattern guidance
- **AI Agents**: The .mdc file contains all necessary behavioral rules and patterns
- **Documentation Links**: Update any references to point to the .mdc file

**Last Updated**: Documentation consolidated into .mdc file for consistency and completeness.
