# Implement Context-Aware Tool Management System

## Context

As our MCP tool ecosystem grows larger and more sophisticated, we face the challenge of **context pollution** - providing AI agents with too many irrelevant tools that consume valuable context space and potentially lead to suboptimal tool selection. Currently, all tools are available to AI agents regardless of the specific task, workflow phase, or session context.

We need intelligent **differential tool availability** that:

1. **Optimizes context usage** - Only provides tools relevant to current work
2. **Improves AI decision-making** - Reduces choice overload and irrelevant tool usage
3. **Adapts to workflow phases** - Different tools for debugging vs. planning vs. implementation
4. **Considers task context** - Tools relevant to specific task types and domains
5. **Supports session context** - Tools appropriate for current session characteristics
6. **Scales with tool growth** - Manages increasing tool complexity intelligently

This system will serve as the foundation for intelligent context management and enhanced AI agent productivity.

## Dependencies

1. **MCP Tool System**: Integrates with existing MCP server and tool infrastructure
2. **Session Management**: Requires session context and current session detection
3. **Task Management**: Integrates with task system for task-specific tool selection
4. **Task #179**: May leverage embeddings for tool description search and matching
5. **Task #253**: May use task similarity for context-aware tool recommendation

## Investigation Areas

### Tool Description Embeddings (Speculative)

Given the large number of tools already available, we should investigate:

1. **Embedding Generation**: Create embeddings for tool descriptions and capabilities
2. **Semantic Tool Search**: Enable natural language search for relevant tools
3. **Tool Similarity Analysis**: Identify overlapping or complementary tools
4. **Context-Tool Matching**: Use embeddings to match tools to current work context
5. **Tool Recommendation**: Suggest tools based on semantic similarity to current tasks

**Research Questions:**

- How effective are embeddings for tool selection compared to rule-based approaches?
- What tool metadata dimensions are most important for embedding generation?
- How can we balance embedding-based selection with performance requirements?
- What are the privacy and security implications of tool description embeddings?

This investigation should be conducted in parallel with core implementation and may inform future enhancements to the tool management system.
