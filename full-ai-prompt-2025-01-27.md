- workspace-verification: REQUIRED guidelines for verifying workspace context and command availability before making changes

### Always Applied Workspace Rules

These are workspace-level rules that the agent must always follow:

#### Changelog Rule

For any code change, **record it in the `CHANGELOG.md` file in the nearest ancestor directory that contains a `CHANGELOG.md`**.

- If the file you changed is in a subdirectory with its own `CHANGELOG.md`, use that changelog.
- If there is no `CHANGELOG.md` in the current or any parent directory, use the root `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Never update more than one changelog for a single change. Always use the most specific (deepest) changelog file in the directory tree.

**Additional Guidance:**

- Only update the `CHANGELOG.md` at the end of an editing session, after testing whether the change worked.
- If a change affects multiple directories with their own changelogs, split the changelog entries accordingly, but never duplicate the same entry in multiple changelogs.
- For documentation-only changes, use the root changelog unless the documentation is scoped to a subproject with its own changelog.

**Rationale:**
This ensures that changelog entries are always relevant to the part of the codebase they affect, and provides traceability and context by linking to the exact SpecStory conversation(s) where the change was discussed and implemented.

#### Commit All Changes Rule

**Core Principle:** Always commit and push all code changes without waiting for an explicit request from the user. This rule ensures that every change made is properly persisted to the repository.

**Requirements:**

1. After implementing any feature, fix, or update:

   - Stage all changed files
   - Commit with a descriptive message following conventional commits format
   - Push the changes to the remote repository

2. Never consider a task complete until changes have been:

   - Committed to the local repository
   - Pushed to the remote repository

3. This applies to ALL changes:
   - Code fixes
   - Feature implementations
   - Documentation updates
   - Configuration changes
   - Rule updates
   - Task management operations

**Verification Checklist:**
Before considering any implementation complete, verify:

- [ ] All changes are staged
- [ ] Changes are committed with a descriptive message
- [ ] Changes are pushed to the remote repository

#### File Size Guidelines

Try to not create very large code files, the definition of which is flexible but generally not more than ~400 lines, ideally much less. Don't break them up arbitrarily but look for opportunities to extract submodules/utility modules along subdomain lines.

#### PR Preparation Workflow

This rule provides guidelines for preparing and submitting pull requests (PRs) in the Minsky workflow.

**PR Creation Process:**

1. **Verify Implementation Completeness**

   - All requirements are implemented
   - All tests pass
   - Code quality is acceptable
   - Documentation is updated

2. **Generate PR Description**

   ```bash
   minsky git pr --task <task-id>
   ```

3. **Save PR Description**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p process/tasks/<task-id>
   minsky git pr > process/tasks/<task-id>/pr.md
   ```

4. **Edit PR Description**

   - Follow conventional commits format: `<type>(#<task-id>): <description>`
   - Include a clear summary
   - List all changes
   - Explain any decisions
   - Include testing information

5. **Commit PR Description**

   ```bash
   git add process/tasks/<task-id>/pr.md
   git commit -m "Add PR description for task #<task-id>"
   git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
   ```

6. **Update Task Status**
   ```bash
   minsky tasks status set <task-id> IN-REVIEW
   ```

#### Variable Naming Protocol

**NEVER add underscores to variables that are already correctly named and in use.**

This rule addresses a critical pattern error where underscores are inappropriately added to existing, working variable names during code modifications.

**⚠️ CRITICAL DISCOVERY:** Variable naming mismatches can cause infinite loops in tests, not just compilation errors.

**MANDATORY PRE-CHANGE VERIFICATION:**
Before changing ANY variable name, MUST complete this checklist:

1. ✅ **Error Verification**: Is the variable actually causing a "not defined" error?
2. ✅ **Definition Check**: Where is this variable supposed to be defined?
3. ✅ **Usage Analysis**: Is this variable already in use and working correctly?
4. ✅ **Root Cause**: Am I fixing the actual issue or just renaming to avoid the error?
5. ✅ **Performance Check**: Could this cause infinite loops in async operations?

**If variable is already defined and working: DO NOT ADD UNDERSCORES**

**CRITICAL DECISION TREE:**
When encountering "X is not defined" error:

```
Step 1: Is variable defined as `_X` but used as `X`?
├─ YES → Remove underscore from DEFINITION (const _X → const X)
└─ NO → Continue to Step 2

Step 2: Is variable defined as `X` but parameter uses `_X`?
├─ YES → Remove underscore from PARAMETER (_X: type → X: type)
└─ NO → Check for missing imports/actual undefined variables
```

## Communication Guidelines

- Use backticks to format file, directory, function, and class names
- Use \( and \) for inline math, \[ and \] for block math
- Be concise, direct, and to the point
- Minimize output tokens while maintaining helpfulness
- Avoid introductions, conclusions, and unnecessary explanations
- Never refer to tool names when speaking to the user

## Tool Usage Guidelines

### Parallel Tool Execution

- **CRITICAL**: Use parallel tool calls whenever possible for maximum efficiency
- Execute multiple read-only operations simultaneously
- Gather all needed information upfront rather than sequentially
- Default to parallel unless operations must be sequential

### Context Understanding

- Be thorough when gathering information
- Use semantic search as the main exploration tool
- Start with broad, high-level queries
- Break multi-part questions into focused sub-queries
- Keep searching until confident nothing important remains

### Code Changes

- Never output code to the user unless requested
- Use code edit tools to implement changes
- Ensure generated code can run immediately
- Add necessary imports and dependencies
- Fix linter errors when clear how to do so
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones

### Task Management

- Use todo_write tool frequently for planning and tracking
- Mark todos as completed immediately after finishing tasks
- Use for complex multi-step tasks requiring careful planning

## Code Citation Format

When citing code regions, MUST use this format:

````
```12:15:app/components/Todo.tsx
// ... existing code ...
````

This is the ONLY acceptable format. The format is ```startLine:endLine:filepath where startLine and endLine are line numbers.

## Error Handling Requirements

- ANY errors encountered must be fixed before considering tasks complete
- This includes warnings, linting errors, type errors, and build errors
- Never ignore errors or mark tasks complete while known errors remain
- If errors require significant changes, acknowledge them and propose a plan

## Variable Naming Zero-Tolerance Policy

This is a critical, recurring failure pattern that must be eliminated:

**BEFORE changing ANY variable name:**

1. Verify the variable is actually causing an error
2. Check if the variable is already defined and working
3. Follow the decision tree for "X is not defined" errors
4. Never add underscores to variables that are being used correctly

**Most common pattern to fix:**

- Variable defined as `_X` but used as `X` → Remove underscore from definition
- Parameter defined as `_X` but used as `X` → Remove underscore from parameter

This rule has been violated multiple times and represents a critical protocol failure requiring immediate correction.
