# Architecture Decision Record: Session PR Workflow

**Date:** 2025-01-24  
**Task:** #174 Review Session PR Workflow Architecture  
**Status:** APPROVED  
**Deciders:** Task #174 Investigation Team

## Context and Problem Statement

The session PR workflow has evolved organically and requires architectural review to ensure consistency, maintainability, and optimal user experience. Key decisions need to be made about:

1. Session update integration (automatic vs optional)
2. Command consolidation (session PR vs git PR)
3. Flag complexity and user experience
4. Error handling and conflict resolution
5. Architecture patterns and design principles

## Decision Drivers

- **User Experience**: Minimize cognitive load while providing power user features
- **Maintainability**: Reduce code duplication and ensure clear separation of concerns
- **Reliability**: Minimize merge conflicts and provide robust error handling
- **Performance**: Optimize for common use cases while supporting edge cases
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintain existing workflows while improving the experience

## Considered Options

### 1. Session Update Integration

**Option A**: Make session update optional (require explicit flag)
**Option B**: Keep session update automatic (current behavior)
**Option C**: Smart detection of when update is needed

### 2. Command Consolidation

**Option A**: Full consolidation into single `minsky pr` command
**Option B**: Partial consolidation with shared service layer
**Option C**: Keep commands completely separate

### 3. Flag Complexity Management

**Option A**: Remove advanced flags, keep only simple interface
**Option B**: Implement preset system for common patterns
**Option C**: Add interactive mode for complex scenarios

## Decision Outcome

### ADR-001: Session Update Integration
**Status**: APPROVED  
**Decision**: Keep session update automatic with enhanced conflict detection

**Rationale**:
- The enhanced ConflictDetectionService handles edge cases well
- Automatic updates ensure PRs are created from latest base
- The `--skip-update` flag provides escape hatch for power users
- Smart detection already implemented for already-merged scenarios

**Implementation**:
- Maintain automatic session update as default behavior
- Enhanced conflict detection with auto-resolution options
- Smart skipping when changes are already merged
- Clear feedback about what operations are being performed

### ADR-002: Command Consolidation
**Status**: APPROVED  
**Decision**: Maintain separate commands with shared service layer

**Rationale**:
- Commands serve different user contexts and mental models
- Session PR is workflow-focused, Git PR is tool-focused
- Consolidation would add complexity without clear benefits
- Shared service layer reduces code duplication

**Implementation**:
- Keep `minsky session pr` and `minsky git pr` as separate commands
- Extract common PR creation logic into shared `PrService`
- Align parameter names and error message formats
- Document when to use each command

### ADR-003: Flag Complexity Management
**Status**: APPROVED  
**Decision**: Implement progressive disclosure with preset system

**Rationale**:
- Current flags provide necessary flexibility for edge cases
- Most users need simple defaults that "just work"
- Preset system can encapsulate common flag combinations
- Progressive disclosure keeps advanced options available

**Implementation**:
- Implement preset system for common patterns
- Maintain all current flags for power users
- Add interactive mode for guided workflows
- Improve documentation with scenario-based patterns

### ADR-004: Error Handling Strategy
**Status**: APPROVED  
**Decision**: Context-aware error handling with recovery assistance

**Rationale**:
- Current enhanced error messages are significant improvement
- Users need actionable recovery guidance
- Context-aware help reduces support burden
- Recovery commands enable self-service resolution

**Implementation**:
- Maintain enhanced error messages with specific guidance
- Add recovery command suggestions to error messages
- Implement contextual help based on current state
- Create step-by-step resolution guides

### ADR-005: Architecture Patterns
**Status**: APPROVED  
**Decision**: Domain-driven design with clear separation of concerns

**Rationale**:
- Current architecture follows good separation of concerns
- Session domain handles workflow logic
- Git domain handles git operations
- Clear interfaces enable testing and maintenance

**Implementation**:
- Maintain current domain-driven architecture
- Extract shared functionality into service layer
- Ensure clear interfaces between domains
- Document architectural patterns and principles

## Design Principles

### 1. Progressive Disclosure
- Simple defaults for common use cases
- Advanced options available but not prominent
- Context-aware help and suggestions

### 2. Fail-Safe Defaults
- Default behavior should be safe and predictable
- Dangerous operations require explicit flags
- Clear warnings for potentially destructive actions

### 3. Clear Separation of Concerns
- Session domain handles workflow logic
- Git domain handles git operations
- Shared services for common functionality

### 4. User-Centric Design
- Optimize for common use cases
- Provide clear feedback on operations
- Enable self-service error resolution

### 5. Backwards Compatibility
- Maintain existing command interfaces
- Deprecate features gracefully
- Provide migration paths for changes

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Command Interface Design

**DO**:
- Provide sensible defaults that work for most users
- Use consistent parameter names across commands
- Implement preset system for common patterns
- Provide clear help documentation

**DON'T**:
- Change existing command behavior without deprecation
- Remove advanced options that power users need
- Create inconsistent interfaces between related commands

### 2. Error Handling

**DO**:
- Provide context-aware error messages
- Suggest specific recovery actions
- Include relevant troubleshooting commands
- Give clear feedback on what went wrong

**DON'T**:
- Show generic error messages
- Provide vague recovery instructions
- Hide important diagnostic information
- Fail silently or with unclear messages

### 3. Service Layer Design

**DO**:
- Extract common functionality into shared services
- Maintain clear interface boundaries
- Enable dependency injection for testing
- Document service responsibilities

**DON'T**:
- Create god objects with too many responsibilities
- Tightly couple services to specific implementations
- Mix domain logic with infrastructure concerns

### 4. User Experience

**DO**:
- Provide clear feedback on long-running operations
- Show progress indicators for multi-step processes
- Offer intelligent suggestions based on context
- Enable users to understand what's happening

**DON'T**:
- Hide what the system is doing
- Provide confusing or contradictory guidance
- Force users to remember complex flag combinations
- Create decision paralysis with too many options

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Testing
- Test individual functions and services
- Mock external dependencies
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Ensure consistent behavior across backends

### 2. Integration Testing
- Test command workflows end-to-end
- Test interaction between domains
- Test error recovery paths
- Verify consistent behavior across scenarios

### 3. User Acceptance Testing

- Validate error recovery experiences
- Test with different user skill levels
- Gather feedback on user experience

## Monitoring and Metrics

### 1. Usage Metrics
- Track command usage patterns
- Monitor error rates and types

- Track conflict detection accuracy
- Measure auto-resolution success rates
- Monitor resource usage

### 3. User Experience Metrics

- Measure time to task completion
- Gather qualitative feedback

## Compliance and Documentation

### 1. Documentation Requirements
- Maintain up-to-date architecture documentation
- Document all architectural decisions
- Create user guides for common scenarios
- Maintain troubleshooting guides

### 2. Code Quality Standards
- Follow established coding patterns
- Maintain consistent error handling

- Maintain backwards compatibility
- Provide migration guides for breaking changes
- Communicate changes to users

## Consequences

### Positive
