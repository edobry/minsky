# Task #093: Implement Consistent CLI Error Handling Across All Commands

## Context

This task is part of improving the user experience of the Minsky CLI. Currently, error messages are verbose and include stack traces, which is not user-friendly. This task aims to implement a consistent error handling approach across all CLI commands to improve the user experience while maintaining detailed logging for debugging purposes.

## Background

The Minsky CLI currently shows verbose error output including stack traces for many errors. This is not user-friendly and can be confusing for users. We need a more consistent approach to error handling across all CLI commands.

## Objectives

1. Create a centralized error handling utility for CLI commands
2. Standardize error message format and content across all command groups
3. Improve user experience by showing concise, helpful error messages
4. Maintain detailed error logging for debugging purposes

## Requirements

1. **Centralized Error Handler:**

   - Create a centralized error handler utility that can be used by all CLI adapters
   - The handler should format user-facing error messages appropriately
   - Stack traces should only be shown in debug mode

2. **Consistent Message Format:**

   - All CLI error messages should follow a consistent format
   - Error messages should be clear, concise, and actionable
   - Related commands should use similar error messaging patterns

3. **Error Logging:**

   - Detailed error information should be logged at debug level for troubleshooting
   - Critical errors should be logged at error level
   - Stack traces should only be included in debug logs

4. **Command-Specific Error Handling:**
   - Each command group should implement the centralized error handling pattern
   - Domain-specific errors should be handled appropriately for each command

## Implementation Suggestions

1. Create a utility module for CLI error handling in the `src/adapters/cli/utils` directory
2. Refactor existing CLI adapters to use the centralized error handler
3. Test error handling with various error conditions
4. Document the error handling pattern for future CLI command implementations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All CLI commands use the centralized error handler
- [ ] Error messages are consistent across all commands
- [ ] Detailed error information is only shown in debug mode
- [ ] User-facing error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Error handling has appropriate test coverage
