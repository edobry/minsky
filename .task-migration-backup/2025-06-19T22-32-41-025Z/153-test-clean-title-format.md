# Test Clean Title Format

## Context

This is a test task specification using the new clean title format without task numbers in the document title. The task number will be managed externally in the filename and tasks.md references.

## Requirements

1. Test that the new parsing logic correctly handles clean titles
2. Verify that task creation preserves the clean title format
3. Ensure backward compatibility is maintained

## Implementation Steps

1. [ ] Create task using new clean format
2. [ ] Verify the title is parsed correctly
3. [ ] Confirm the spec file maintains clean title after creation

## Verification

- [ ] Task creation succeeds with clean title format
- [ ] Generated task file has clean title (not Task #XXX: format)
- [ ] Task appears correctly in tasks.md with proper ID reference
