## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM

All project documentation will be stored in the `.specstory` directory, following the SpecStory format.  Version updates will be noted in the relevant section headers (e.g., "TECH STACK", "WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES").


## TECH STACK

- TypeScript
- Bun
- Commander
- Git


## CODING STANDARDS

- All business logic must be organized in per-domain modules (e.g., `src/domain`).
- Command modules (e.g., `src/commands`) should only contain CLI-related logic (reading options, setting up the environment, calling domain modules, writing output, etc.).
- Each subcommand should reside in its own directory under `src/commands/<command-name>/`.  Main command files should be named `index.ts`.


## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES

- Use `bun init -y` to initialize new Bun projects.
- Use `bun add` to add dependencies.
- Commit frequently with clear, concise messages.
- Follow semantic versioning for releases.


## DEBUGGING

- Use `console.log` for debugging purposes.  Remove or comment out debug statements before committing.

# Command Organization Rules

## Directory Structure
- Each subcommand should be in its own directory under `src/commands/<command-name>/`
- Example: `src/commands/git/clone.ts` for the git clone command
- Main command files should be named `index.ts` in their respective directories

## Module Organization
- Business logic should be in domain modules under `src/domain/`
- Command modules should only handle CLI concerns (options, environment, output)
- Example: Business logic in `src/domain/git.ts`, CLI handling in `src/commands/git/clone.ts`
