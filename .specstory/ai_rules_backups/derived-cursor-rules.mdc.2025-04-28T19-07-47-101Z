## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM

All project documentation will be stored in the `.specstory` directory, following the SpecStory format. Version updates will be noted in the relevant section headers (e.g., "TECH STACK", "WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES").  The changelog will reference relevant SpecStory conversation histories.  See `.specstory/.what-is-this.md` for details on the SpecStory artifact system.


## TECH STACK

- TypeScript
- Bun
- Commander
- Git
- bun-promptx
- @clack/prompts


## CODING STANDARDS

- All business logic must be organized in per-domain modules (e.g., `src/domain`).
- Command modules (e.g., `src/commands`) should only contain CLI-related logic (reading options, setting up the environment, calling domain modules, writing output, etc.).
- Each subcommand should reside in its own directory under `src/commands/<command-name>/`.  Main command files should be named `index.ts`.


## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES

- Use `bun init -y` to initialize new Bun projects.
- Use `bun add` to add dependencies.
- Commit frequently with clear, concise messages.
- Follow semantic versioning for releases.
- Use `bun link` to link the CLI globally after installation.
- Use `chmod +x src/cli.ts` to make the main CLI file executable.
- A session database (`session-db.json`) will track sessions, their associated repos, and branches.  This database is stored in `$XDG_STATE_HOME/minsky`.
- Version 0.1.0 initial setup
- Version 0.2.0 added git clone, branch, pr commands and session management
- Version 0.3.0 added session start command and improved session management
- Version 0.4.0 added optional repo path to `git pr` command
- Version 0.5.0 added `tasks` command with `list`, `get`, and `status` subcommands.  Supports `process/tasks.md` as a default task backend.  Placeholder backends for GitHub Issues and other systems are planned. _See: SpecStory history [2025-04-26_22-29-task-management-command-design](.specstory/history/2025-04-26_22-29-task-management-command-design.md)_
- Version 0.6.0 Added support for session and repo path arguments to tasks commands. _See: SpecStory history [2025-04-26_22-29-task-management-command-design](.specstory/history/2025-04-26_22-29-task-management-command-design.md)_

- Version 0.17.0 Added tasks command with support for session and repo path arguments.  Updated tasks.md parsing to handle checklist format and ignore code blocks.  Improved error handling for invalid task statuses.  The tasks.md file format is now strictly enforced.
- Version 0.18.0 Added support for `--debug` flag to `git pr` command, enabling debug logs to stderr. Improved base branch detection logic for `git pr`, prioritizing `main` then `master`, then remote HEAD, then upstream.  Added robust testing for `git pr` and `tasks` commands.  Improved error handling and user feedback for `tasks status set`.  Refactored `resolveRepoPath` into shared utility module.  Updated README and CHANGELOG.
- Version 0.19.0 The `session start` command now optionally accepts a task ID. If provided, the CLI looks up task details, uses the task ID as the session name (formatted as `<repo>/task#<id>`), and stores the task details in the session metadata.  The session will have a full name and a short name (without the repo, for branch naming).
- Version 0.20.0 The `tasks list` and `tasks get` commands now support a `--json` option for JSON output.
- Version 0.21.0 The `session start` command now supports the `--task <task-id>` flag. If provided, the CLI looks up the task details using the `tasks` domain module, uses the task ID as the session short name (formatted as `task#<id>`), and stores the task ID in the session metadata.  The session will have a full name (`<repo>/task#<id>`) and a short name (`task#<id>`) for branch naming.  Error handling is improved to check for existing tasks and sessions.
- Version 0.22.0 The `minsky session start` command now optionally accepts a task ID via the `--task` flag. If provided, the CLI looks up the task details, uses the task ID as the session short name (formatted as `task#<id>`), and stores the task ID in the session metadata. The session will have a full name (`<repo>/task#<id>`) and a short name (`task#<id>`) for branch naming. Error handling is improved to check for existing tasks and sessions.  If the task ID does not exist, the CLI errors out. If a session for that task already exists, the CLI errors out and returns the existing session name.
- Version 0.23.0 The `session list` and `session get` commands now support a `--json` option for JSON output.
- Version 0.24.0 Added CLI-level tests for the `--json` option in `tasks list`, `tasks get`, `session list`, and `session get` commands.
- Version 0.25.0 The session database now stores the repo name for each session. Session repos are stored under a per-repo directory (e.g., `/Users/edobry/.local/state/minsky/git/<repo>/<session>`).
- Version 0.26.0 Renamed `session cd` command to `session dir`. The `session dir` command now prints the session directory path.  The `session cd` command has been removed.
- Version 0.27.0 Added IN PROGRESS and IN REVIEW task statuses.  `-` represents IN PROGRESS and `+` represents IN REVIEW in markdown task lists.
- Version 0.28.0 Added `init` command to set up minsky projects.  Supports `tasks.md` and `tasks.csv` backends and `cursor` and `generic` rule formats.  Creates `process/tasks` directory structure.  Writes `minsky.mdc` rule to `.cursor/rules` or `.ai/rules` depending on the selected rule format.  Creates `process/tasks` directory structure.  Writes `minsky.mdc` rule to `.cursor/rules` or `.ai/rules` depending on the selected rule format.
- Version 0.29.0 Added `init` command. Supports `tasks.md` backend and `cursor` and `generic` rule formats. Creates `process/tasks` directory structure. Writes `minsky.mdc` rule to `.cursor/rules` or `.ai/rules` depending on the selected rule format. The `tasks.csv` backend is planned for a future release. The `init` command will create necessary directories if they don't exist. If files already exist, the command will prompt the user before overwriting. CLI flags override interactive prompts. If no flags or interactive input is given, the CLI defaults to creating `tasks.md` and writing to `.cursor/rules`.
- Version 0.30.0 Added support for `--path` argument to `init` command to specify the target project directory. Improved error handling for `init` command to handle existing files and directories. Added tests for `init` command. Updated README and CHANGELOG.
- Version 0.31.0 Added bun-promptx for interactive prompts in init command. Improved error handling and user experience for init command. Updated README and CHANGELOG.
- Version 0.32.0 Added improved UX for init command using bun-promptx.  Improved error handling for init command. Updated README and CHANGELOG.  Added support for --repo and --session flags to init command, using resolveRepoPath for repo path resolution.  Added tests for init command including error handling and prompt logic.
- Version 0.33.0 Updated init command to use @clack/prompts for interactive prompts. Improved error handling and user experience for init command. Updated README and CHANGELOG.
- Version 0.34.0  Added `minsky tasks list --json` as a method for querying the backlog.
- Version 0.35.0 Added clarification on how to query the backlog using `minsky tasks list --json`.
- Version 0.36.0 To query the backlog, use: `minsky tasks list --json`
- Version 0.37.0 To query the backlog, use `minsky tasks list --json`.  This command will return a JSON representation of all tasks in the backlog.  The output will include task IDs, titles, statuses, and descriptions.
- Version 0.38.0 To query the backlog, use `minsky tasks list --json`. This command returns a JSON representation of all tasks.  The output includes task IDs, titles, statuses, and descriptions.
- Version 0.39.0 Clarified that `minsky tasks list --json` should be used to query the backlog.
- Version 0.40.0 The `--repo` argument for `minsky session start` is now optional.  If omitted, the command will attempt to determine the repository path using `resolveRepoPath`. If it fails to find a repository, it will error out with a clear message.
- Version 0.41.0 Added tests for the updated `minsky session start` command, including cases where `--repo` is provided and omitted.
- Version 0.42.0 The `minsky session start` command now correctly handles optional `--repo` argument.  If omitted, it uses `resolveRepoPath` to determine the repository path.  If no repository is found, it errors out with a clear message.  Added comprehensive tests covering various scenarios, including successful execution with and without `--repo`, error handling when no repository is found, and correct usage of `resolveRepoPath`.
- Version 0.43.0 The `--repo` argument for the `minsky session start` command is now optional. If omitted, the command will attempt to determine the repository path using `resolveRepoPath`. If `resolveRepoPath` fails to find a repository, the command will error out with a clear message.
- Version 0.44.0  The `minsky session start` command now correctly handles the optional `--repo` argument. If omitted, it uses `resolveRepoPath` to determine the repository path. If no repository is found, it errors out with a clear message.  Added comprehensive tests covering various scenarios, including successful execution with and without `--repo`, error handling when no repository is found, and correct usage of `resolveRepoPath`.  The tests now use bun:test's mocking capabilities.
- Version 0.45.0 The `--repo` argument for `minsky session start` is now optional. If omitted, the command will attempt to determine the repository path using `resolveRepoPath`.  If `resolveRepoPath` fails, the command will error out with a clear message.  The `minsky session start` command's business logic has been extracted to `startSession` for better testability.  Comprehensive tests have been added for `startSession` using bun:test mocking capabilities to cover various scenarios, including successful execution with and without `--repo`, error handling when no repository is found, and correct usage of `resolveRepoPath`.
- Version 0.46.0 The `minsky session start` command's business logic has been extracted to `startSession` for better testability. Comprehensive tests have been added for `startSession`, covering various scenarios, including successful execution with and without `--repo`, error handling when no repository is found, and correct usage of `resolveRepoPath`. The tests use Bun's mocking capabilities.  A positive test case was added for the fallback scenario where `resolveRepoPath` returns a valid path.
- Version 0.47.0  The `--repo` argument is now optional for `minsky session start`. If omitted, the command attempts to use the current git repository root via `resolveRepoPath`. If neither a repo nor a session is provided and `resolveRepoPath` fails, the command errors out with a clear message. The `minsky session start` command's business logic has been extracted to `startSession` for better testability.  Comprehensive tests have been added for `startSession`, covering various scenarios, including successful execution with and without `--repo`, error handling when no repository is found, and correct usage of `resolveRepoPath`.  The tests use Bun's mocking capabilities.
- Version 0.48.0 Added tests for startSession command.  The tests utilize Bun's mocking capabilities to isolate and test the core logic.  The tests cover various scenarios, including successful execution with and without the --repo flag, error handling when no repository is found, and the correct usage of resolveRepoPath.  All tests pass.
- Version 0.49.0 Updated `startSession` to accept dependencies via parameters, enabling direct dependency injection in tests.  Updated tests to inject mocks directly, avoiding `mock.module`. All tests pass.
- Version 0.50.0 Added a positive test case for the fallback scenario where `resolveRepoPath` returns a valid path in `startSession.test.ts`. All tests pass.
- Version 0.51.0 Added support for associating sessions with tasks via the `--task <taskId>` option in `session start` command. The task ID is stored in the session record and used to generate the session name. Enhanced error handling to validate task existence and prevent duplicate sessions for the same task. Updated all relevant tests. _See: SpecStory history [2025-04-28_16-22-backlog-task-inquiry](.specstory/history/2025-04-28_16-22-backlog-task-inquiry.md) for implementation details._
- Version 0.52.0 Improved the minsky-workflow.mdc documentation to address feedback from junior engineer simulations.  Clarified task ID formatting, added instructions for handling JSON output using jq, clarified session name requirements, improved session start output, added instructions for updating the changelog and task spec, and clarified the use of IN-REVIEW and DONE task statuses.  Added a new task to add the task spec document path to the minsky tasks get command output.
- Version 0.53.0 Updated instructions for finding existing sessions to use `minsky session get` instead of listing and filtering with `jq`. Added task #004 to add a `--task` option to `session get` to query sessions by task ID.
- Version 0.54.0 Added task #005 to add a `minsky git push` command.
- Version 0.55.0 Added task #006 to improve the output of the `session start` command for programmatic use cases.
- Version 0.56.0 Updated minsky-workflow.mdc to reflect changes from task #006.
- Version 0.57.0 Added a global rule mandating the use of `jq` for JSON parsing and filtering instead of `grep`.
- Version 0.58.0 Added task #007 to add a global rule about using `jq` for JSON parsing.
- Version 0.59.0 Added automation directive to minsky-workflow.mdc to ensure that when queried about task status or availability, the AI will always run the appropriate minsky CLI command to retrieve real-time data.
- Version 0.60.0 Added task #008: Add a `minsky task create` command that takes a task spec document path and records it as a task using the appropriate domain module method.
- Version 0.61.0 Added `minsky task create` command. This command takes a task spec document path as an argument and creates a new task entry in the task database.  The task spec document path is stored in the task record.
- Version 0.62.0 Added task #009: Improve AI instructions to avoid prematurely implementing tasks.
- Version 0.63.0 Added task #010: Create a task specification for adding a `minsky task create` command.
- Version 0.64.0 Added task #011: Implement `minsky task create` command.
- Version 0.65.0 Added task #008: Update `tasks list` command to filter out DONE tasks by default, adding a CLI option to include them.
- Version 0.66.0 Added rule to always use `jq` for JSON parsing and filtering.
- Version 0.67.0 Before implementing any task, ALWAYS ensure a valid session exists.  If no session exists for the task, create one using `minsky session start --task <task-id>`. Then, navigate to the session directory before making any code changes. Document these steps in the task specification.
- Version 0.68.0 Enhanced minsky-workflow rule with a critical "Session-First Implementation" requirement, mandating session creation and activation before any code examination or modification.  The rule now includes a prominent warning at the beginning, three specific steps to ensure a valid session exists, and a clear statement about the consequences of violating this rule.


## DEBUGGING

- Use `console.log` for debugging purposes.  Remove or comment out debug statements before committing.


## CURSOR RULES

### command-organization.mdc
```

description: Command organization rules for the minsky CLI
globs: ["src/commands/**/*.ts"]
alwaysApply: true
---

# Command Organization Rules

## Directory Structure
- Each subcommand should be in its own directory under `src/commands/<command-name>/`
- Example: `src/commands/git/clone.ts` for the git clone command
- Main command files should be named `index.ts` in their respective directories

## Module Organization
- Business logic should be in domain modules under `src/domain/`
- Command modules should only handle CLI concerns (options, environment, output)
- Example: Business logic in `src/domain/git.ts`, CLI handling in `src/commands/git/clone.ts` 
```

### module-organization.mdc

# Module Organization Rules

## Domain Modules
- All business logic should live in `src/domain/` modules
- Domain modules should be focused on a single domain concept
- Example: `src/domain/git.ts` for git-related business logic

## Command Modules
Command modules should only handle:
- Parsing command-line arguments and options
- Setting up the environment
- Calling domain modules
- Formatting and displaying output
- Error handling and exit codes

Example: `src/commands/git/clone.ts` should only handle CLI concerns while delegating actual git operations to `src/domain/git.ts`
```

# Minsky Workflow

This rule defines the comprehensive process for working with tasks using the Minsky tool. All code changes must follow this process to maintain consistency and quality.

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: SESSION-FIRST IMPLEMENTATION

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: A SESSION MUST BE CREATED AND ACTIVE BEFORE ANY CODE CHANGES**

Before examining or modifying any code, you MUST:
1. Verify task status (`minsky tasks status get '#id'`)
2. Create or identify an existing session (`minsky session start --task id`)
3. Enter the session directory (`cd $(minsky session dir session-name)`)

No code examination or changes are permitted until these steps are complete.
Violating this rule compromises the entire workflow system.

## Request Interpretation and Workflow Priority

1. **Always interpret requests based on their literal meaning in the project context**
    - "Create a task" means creating a task specification document, not implementing code
    - "Implement" or "code" refers to writing the actual implementation
    - When in doubt, default to task specification over implementation

2. **Request Type Recognition**
    - Categorize requests as either "specifying work" or "implementing work"
    - Each category requires different response patterns:
      - Specifying work → create task specification documents
      - Implementing work → write code following existing specifications
    - Never implement code until the specification is verified

3. **When to Request Clarification**
    - If a request could be interpreted multiple ways, ask for clarification
    - Examples of ambiguous requests requiring clarification:
      - "Work on task #123" (specify or implement?)
      - "Handle the task creation feature" (create spec or code?)
      - "Add the minsky task create command" (create spec or implement?)
    - Always err on the side of creating task specifications when unclear

4. **Clear vs. Ambiguous Request Examples**
    - Clear Specification Request: "Create a task to add a minsky task create command"
      → Create a task specification document
    - Clear Implementation Request: "Implement the minsky task create command according to task #007"  
      → Implement the code following the specification
    - Ambiguous Request: "Add the minsky task create command"
      → Default to creating a task specification unless context clearly indicates implementation

**Automation Directive:** Whenever you are asked about the current state of tasks, sessions, or any live project data, always run the appropriate `minsky` CLI command (e.g., `minsky tasks list --json`, `minsky tasks status get <id>`, etc.) to retrieve real-time information. Do not rely solely on static documentation, code, or cached data for these queries. Only supplement with documentation or codebase details if the CLI output is insufficient or ambiguous. This ensures all answers reflect the actual, current state of the project.

## Task Selection and Initial Setup

When asked to work on a task (by name, description, or ID):

1. **Find or Access the Task**
   - If you already know the task ID (e.g., "001" or "#001"):
     ```bash
     # Get direct information about a specific task
     minsky tasks get '#001' --json
     ```
   - If you need to find a task from the backlog:  When asked to list, filter, or check the status of tasks, always run:
     ```bash
     minsky tasks list --json
     ```
     and present the output directly, unless specifically instructed otherwise.
     > **Note:** Always use `jq` for JSON parsing, not `grep`. This is a general best practice for all projects.

2. **Check Task Status**
   - Before starting any work, check the current status of the task:
     ```bash
     minsky tasks status get '#001'
     ```
   - Task status meanings:
     - `TODO`: Not started, available to work on
     - `IN-PROGRESS`: Work has begun but is not complete
     - `IN-REVIEW`: Work is complete and awaiting review
     - `DONE`: Work is complete, reviewed, and merged
   - If the task is already marked as `DONE` or `IN-REVIEW`, confirm with the user before proceeding.

3. **Understand Requirements**
   - Read the task specification document shown in the output of `minsky tasks get`
   - The path is typically `process/tasks/<task-id>-<task-name>.md` (e.g., `process/tasks/001-update-session-start.md`)
   - Ensure all requirements and acceptance criteria are clearly understood
   - Note any dependencies or blocking issues

## Creating New Tasks

When asked to create a new task:

1. **Refer to the creating-tasks rule**
    - See detailed instructions in the `creating-tasks.mdc` rule
    - Never implement code when asked to create a task unless explicitly instructed
    - Always create a well-formatted task specification document

2. **Checklist Steps for Task Creation**
    - Create a task specification document following the standardized format
    - Add the task to the main task list in `/process/tasks.md`
    - Use the next available task ID
    - Link the task correctly following project conventions


## Session Management

### Starting a New Session

1. **Create a Task Session**
   - Begin a new session for the task (no session name needed when using `--task`):
     ```bash
     minsky session start --task 001
     ```
   - The output will show:
     - The auto-generated session name (e.g., `task#001`)
     - The repository location where files were cloned
     - The branch name that was created (same as session name)
     - The task ID association
     - Command to navigate to the session directory
     - The session directory path (for programmatic use)

2. **Enter the Session Directory**
    - Navigate to the session directory using the provided command

### Re-entering an Existing Session

When asked to continue working on a task:

1. **Find Existing Session**
   - Look up the session associated with the task:
     ```bash
     # Use session get to get details about a specific session
     minsky session get task#001
     ```
   - If you don't know the session name, you may need to list all sessions:
     ```bash
     # List all sessions and filter for the task ID using jq
     minsky session list --json | jq '.[] | select(.taskId == "#001")'
     ```
   - Note: A future enhancement will add a `--task` option to the `session get` command to directly query sessions by task ID

2. **Enter Existing Session**
   - Navigate to the session directory:
     ```bash
     cd $(minsky session dir task#001)
     ```
   - If no session exists, create one as described in "Starting a New Session"

### Programmatic Usage

When integrating Minsky into scripts or automated workflows, use the `--quiet` option to suppress all non-essential output:

```bash
SESSION_DIR=$(minsky session start my-session --repo https://github.com/user/repo.git --quiet)
```

This command will output only the session directory path, making it easy to integrate into scripts and pipelines.


## Implementation Process

1. **Planning**
   - Review the task document to ensure full understanding
   - For a new task, draft an implementation plan and append it to the task document
   - For continuing work, review the task's "Work Log" section to see progress

2. **Implementation**
   - Follow all project coding standards and best practices
   - Implement the required changes, addressing all requirements
   - Commit changes at logical intervals with clear, descriptive messages
   - Reference the task ID in all commit messages (e.g., "Implement feature X for #001")

3. **Work Log**
   - Maintain a "Work Log" section in the task document:
     ```markdown
     ## Work Log
     - YYYY-MM-DD: Implemented X feature
     - YYYY-MM-DD: Fixed Y bug
     - YYYY-MM-DD: Added tests for Z functionality
     ```
   - This log will be used to update the changelog when the task is complete

4. **Testing**
   - Write appropriate tests for all new functionality
   - Ensure all existing tests continue to pass

## Verification and Documentation

1. **Verification**
   - Verify that all requirements have been implemented correctly
   - Check off completed verification steps in the task document by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`
   - Ensure that all tests pass

2. **Documentation**
   - Update the task document with implementation details
   - Document any design decisions or compromises made during implementation
   - Update any relevant project documentation

3. **Changelog**
   - Follow the instructions in the [changelog rule](mdc:changelog.mdc) for updating the appropriate CHANGELOG.md
   - Use the Work Log from the task document as the basis for changelog entries
   - Reference the task ID in the changelog entry

## Task Completion

1. **PR Preparation**
   - Generate a PR description:
     ```bash
     minsky git pr
     ```
   - Minsky will automatically create necessary directories and save the PR description to:
     ```
     process/tasks/<task-id>/pr.md
     ```
   - Commit this PR description file

2. **Finalization**
   - Push your branch:
     ```bash
     # Current approach (standard git command)
     git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
     
     # Future: Will be simplified with dedicated command (Task #005)
     # minsky git push
     ```
   - Note: Task #005 is in progress to simplify this step with a dedicated command

3. **Status Update**
   - Update the task status to the appropriate state:
     ```bash
     # Use IN-REVIEW after you've generated a PR and pushed your changes
     minsky tasks status set '#001' IN-REVIEW

     # Use DONE only after the changes have been reviewed and merged
     minsky tasks status set '#001' DONE
     ```

## Important Notes

- Never skip verification steps or mark a task complete without meeting all requirements
- Always check the existing task status before beginning work
- Reference the task number in all PRs, commits, and documentation
- Maintain a Work Log in the task document to track implementation progress
- If modifications to the requirements are needed, discuss and document them in the task document
- When a task spans multiple sessions, use the Work Log to ensure continuity
- Always use jq for parsing JSON output, not grep or other text-based tools
- Minsky manages branch names, session directories, and other infrastructure—you don't need to create these manually
- **Before starting any implementation work, ALWAYS ensure a valid session exists for the task. If one doesn't exist, create it using `minsky session start --task <task-id>` and then navigate to the session directory.**

# Task Creation Process

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Task Creation vs. Task Implementation
In Minsky, "creating a task" means authoring a task specification document and adding it to the tracking system - **not** implementing the code for that task.

- When the user requests to "create a task", always produce a task specification document
- Only proceed to implementation if explicitly instructed with phrases like "implement the task" or "write the code for"
- If there is any ambiguity, confirm with the user whether they want task specification or implementation

## Overview
All tasks and work items must be tracked using the canonical process described here. Ad-hoc or freeform task files (e.g., TODO.something.md) are NOT permitted. All tasks must be:
- Listed in `/process/tasks.md` as a checklist item
- Linked to a detailed task spec in `/process/tasks/{id}-{name}.md`

## Step-by-Step Task Creation Instructions

### 1. Check for Existing Tasks
- Before starting any new work, check `/process/tasks.md` for an existing task that matches your intended work.
- If a relevant task exists, follow its linked specification.

### 2. Add a New Task
- If no relevant task exists, add a new checklist item to `/process/tasks.md` using the following format:
  ```markdown
  - [ ] Task Title [#NNN](tasks/NNN-task-title.md)
  ```
  - Use the next available task number (NNN).
  - The title should be concise but descriptive.

### 3. Create the Task Specification Document
- Create a new file in `/process/tasks/` named `{NNN}-task-title.md`.
- The task spec should include:
  - **Objective**: What is the goal of the task?
  - **Context**: Background information and why this task is needed
  - **Requirements**: Specific, detailed requirements
  - **Implementation Steps**: A checklist of all required steps and substeps
  - **Verification**: What must be true for the task to be considered complete?
- Use checkboxes for all actionable items and sub-items.
- Include any relevant context, links, or references.

## Complete Example of a Task Specification

Here's a complete example of a properly formatted task specification document:

```markdown
# Task #007: Add `minsky task create` Command

## Context

The Minsky CLI currently lacks a streamlined way to create new tasks from specification documents. Users need to manually update the tasks.md file and ensure proper linking. An automated command would improve workflow efficiency and reduce errors.

## Requirements

1. **CLI Behavior**
   - Command signature:
     ```
     minsky tasks create <spec-path>
     ```
   - The command should:
     - Parse the provided task specification document
     - Extract the title and description
     - Assign the next available ID
     - Add a checklist item to process/tasks.md
     - Return the created task details

2. **Integration with Domain Module**
   - Use the TaskService domain module to record the task
   - Add a createTask method to the TaskService class
   - Implement createTask in the MarkdownTaskBackend

3. **Error Handling**
   - Validate that the spec file exists
   - Ensure the spec file has a valid title and description
   - Handle errors gracefully with informative messages

4. **CLI Options**
   - Support the following options:
     - `--session <session>`: Session name to use for repo resolution
     - `--repo <repoPath>`: Path to a git repository (overrides session)
     - `--backend <backend>`: Specify task backend (markdown, github)
     - `--json`: Output task as JSON

## Implementation Steps

1. [ ] Update TaskBackend interface to include createTask method
2. [ ] Implement createTask in MarkdownTaskBackend:
   - [ ] Parse the spec file to extract title and description
   - [ ] Find the next available task ID
   - [ ] Create a task entry in tasks.md
   - [ ] Return the created Task object
3. [ ] Add createTask method to TaskService
4. [ ] Create a new file in src/commands/tasks/create.ts:
   - [ ] Define command using Commander.js
   - [ ] Add appropriate options and arguments
   - [ ] Implement action handler to call domain method
   - [ ] Add proper error handling
5. [ ] Register command in src/commands/tasks/index.ts
6. [ ] Add tests for the new functionality
7. [ ] Update documentation

## Verification

- [ ] Running `minsky tasks create path/to/spec.md` successfully creates a task
- [ ] The task
