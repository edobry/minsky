## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM

All project documentation will be stored in the `.specstory` directory, following the SpecStory format. Version updates will be noted in the relevant section headers (e.g., "TECH STACK", "WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES").  The changelog will reference relevant SpecStory conversation histories.  See `.specstory/.what-is-this.md` for details on the SpecStory artifact system.


## TECH STACK

- TypeScript
- Bun
- Commander
- Git
- bun-promptx
- @clack/prompts


## CODING STANDARDS

- All business logic must be organized in per-domain modules (e.g., `src/domain`).
- Command modules (e.g., `src/commands`) should only contain CLI-related logic (reading options, setting up the environment, calling domain modules, writing output, etc.).
- Each subcommand should reside in its own directory under `src/commands/<command-name>/`.  Main command files should be named `index.ts`.


## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES

- Use `bun init -y` to initialize new Bun projects.
- Use `bun add` to add dependencies.
- Commit frequently with clear, concise messages.
- Follow semantic versioning for releases.
- Use `bun link` to link the CLI globally after installation.
- Use `chmod +x src/cli.ts` to make the main CLI file executable.
- A session database (`session-db.json`) will track sessions, their associated repos, and branches.  This database is stored in `$XDG_STATE_HOME/minsky`.
- Version 0.1.0 initial setup
- Version 0.2.0 added git clone, branch, pr commands and session management
- Version 0.3.0 added session start command and improved session management
- Version 0.4.0 added optional repo path to `git pr` command
- Version 0.5.0 added `tasks` command with `list`, `get`, and `status` subcommands.  Supports `process/tasks.md` as a default task backend.  Placeholder backends for GitHub Issues and other systems are planned. _See: SpecStory history [2025-04-26_22-29-task-management-command-design](.specstory/history/2025-04-26_22-29-task-management-command-design.md)_
- Version 0.6.0 Added support for session and repo path arguments to tasks commands. _See: SpecStory history [2025-04-26_22-29-task-management-command-design](.specstory/history/2025-04-26_22-29-task-management-command-design.md)_
- Version 0.7.0 Added git branch command.
- Version 0.8.0 Added git pr command with optional repo path.
- Version 0.9.0 Added session db and session management commands (list, get, cd, start).
- Version 0.10.0 Added support for session and repo path arguments to tasks commands.  The tasks.md file format has been updated to support checklist items.
- Version 0.11.0 Added support for session and repo path arguments to tasks commands.  The tasks.md file format is now strictly enforced.
- Version 0.12.0 Added support for session and repo path arguments to tasks commands. The tasks.md file format is now strictly enforced.  The `git pr` command now compares against `main` by default.
- Version 0.13.0 Added support for repo path argument to `git pr` command.  Improved base branch detection logic for `git pr`.
- Version 0.14.0 Added support for session and repo path arguments to all tasks subcommands.  Updated tasks.md parsing to handle checklist format and ignore code blocks.
- Version 0.15.0 Added git branch command.  The `git pr` command now compares against `main` by default, falling back to `master`, remote HEAD, upstream, and finally first commit.
- Version 0.16.0 Added support for session and repo path arguments to all tasks commands.  Updated tasks.md parsing to handle checklist format and ignore code blocks.  Improved error handling for invalid task statuses.
- Version 0.17.0 Added tasks command with support for session and repo path arguments.  Updated tasks.md parsing to handle checklist format and ignore code blocks.  Improved error handling for invalid task statuses.  The tasks.md file format is now strictly enforced.
- Version 0.18.0 Added support for `--debug` flag to `git pr` command, enabling debug logs to stderr. Improved base branch detection logic for `git pr`, prioritizing `main` then `master`, then remote HEAD, then upstream.  Added robust testing for `git pr` and `tasks` commands.  Improved error handling and user feedback for `tasks status set`.  Refactored `resolveRepoPath` into shared utility module.  Updated README and CHANGELOG.
- Version 0.19.0 The `session start` command now optionally accepts a task ID. If provided, the CLI looks up task details, uses the task ID as the session name (formatted as `<repo>/task#<id>`), and stores the task details in the session metadata.  The session will have a full name and a short name (without the repo, for branch naming).
- Version 0.20.0 The `tasks list` and `tasks get` commands now support a `--json` option for JSON output.
- Version 0.21.0 The `session start` command now supports the `--task <task-id>` flag. If provided, the CLI looks up the task details using the `tasks` domain module, uses the task ID as the session short name (formatted as `task#<id>`), and stores the task ID in the session metadata.  The session will have a full name (`<repo>/task#<id>`) and a short name (`task#<id>`) for branch naming.  Error handling is improved to check for existing tasks and sessions.
- Version 0.22.0 The `minsky session start` command now optionally accepts a task ID via the `--task` flag. If provided, the CLI looks up the task details, uses the task ID as the session short name (formatted as `task#<id>`), and stores the task ID in the session metadata. The session will have a full name (`<repo>/task#<id>`) and a short name (`task#<id>`) for branch naming. Error handling is improved to check for existing tasks and sessions.  If the task ID does not exist, the CLI errors out. If a session for that task already exists, the CLI errors out and returns the existing session name.
- Version 0.23.0 The `session list` and `session get` commands now support a `--json` option for JSON output.
- Version 0.24.0 Added CLI-level tests for the `--json` option in `tasks list`, `tasks get`, `session list`, and `session get` commands.
- Version 0.25.0 The session database now stores the repo name for each session. Session repos are stored under a per-repo directory (e.g., `/Users/edobry/.local/state/minsky/git/<repo>/<session>`).
- Version 0.26.0 Renamed `session cd` command to `session dir`. The `session dir` command now prints the session directory path.  The `session cd` command has been removed.
- Version 0.27.0 Added IN PROGRESS and IN REVIEW task statuses.  `-` represents IN PROGRESS and `+` represents IN REVIEW in markdown task lists.
- Version 0.28.0 Added `init` command to set up minsky projects.  Supports `tasks.md` and `tasks.csv` backends and `cursor` and `generic` rule formats.  Creates `process/tasks` directory structure.  Writes `minsky.mdc` rule to `.cursor/rules` or `.ai/rules` depending on the selected rule format.  Creates `process/tasks` directory structure.  Writes `minsky.mdc` rule to `.cursor/rules` or `.ai/rules` depending on the selected rule format.
- Version 0.29.0 Added `init` command. Supports `tasks.md` backend and `cursor` and `generic` rule formats. Creates `process/tasks` directory structure. Writes `minsky.mdc` rule to `.cursor/rules` or `.ai/rules` depending on the selected rule format. The `tasks.csv` backend is planned for a future release. The `init` command will create necessary directories if they don't exist. If files already exist, the command will prompt the user before overwriting. CLI flags override interactive prompts. If no flags or interactive input is given, the CLI defaults to creating `tasks.md` and writing to `.cursor/rules`.
- Version 0.30.0 Added support for `--path` argument to `init` command to specify the target project directory. Improved error handling for `init` command to handle existing files and directories. Added tests for `init` command. Updated README and CHANGELOG.
- Version 0.31.0 Added bun-promptx for interactive prompts in init command. Improved error handling and user experience for init command. Updated README and CHANGELOG.
- Version 0.32.0 Added improved UX for init command using bun-promptx.  Improved error handling for init command. Updated README and CHANGELOG.  Added support for --repo and --session flags to init command, using resolveRepoPath for repo path resolution.  Added tests for init command including error handling and prompt logic.
- Version 0.33.0 Updated init command to use @clack/prompts for interactive prompts. Improved error handling and user experience for init command. Updated README and CHANGELOG.
- Version 0.34.0  Added `minsky tasks list --json` as a method for querying the backlog.
- Version 0.35.0 Added clarification on how to query the backlog using `minsky tasks list --json`.
- Version 0.36.0 To query the backlog, use: `minsky tasks list --json`
- Version 0.37.0 To query the backlog, use `minsky tasks list --json`.  This command will return a JSON representation of all tasks in the backlog.  The output will include task IDs, titles, statuses, and descriptions.
- Version 0.38.0 To query the backlog, use `minsky tasks list --json`. This command returns a JSON representation of all tasks.  The output includes task IDs, titles, statuses, and descriptions.
- Version 0.39.0 Clarified that `minsky tasks list --json` should be used to query the backlog.
- Version 0.40.0 The `--repo` argument for `minsky session start` is now optional.  If omitted, the command will attempt to determine the repository path using `resolveRepoPath`. If it fails to find a repository, it will error out with a clear message.
- Version 0.41.0 Added tests for the updated `minsky session start` command, including cases where `--repo` is provided and omitted.
- Version 0.42.0 The `minsky session start` command now correctly handles optional `--repo` argument.  If omitted, it uses `resolveRepoPath` to determine the repository path.  If no repository is found, it errors out with a clear message.  Added comprehensive tests covering various scenarios, including successful execution with and without `--repo`, error handling when no repository is found, and correct usage of `resolveRepoPath`.
- Version 0.43.0 The `--repo` argument for the `minsky session start` command is now optional. If omitted, the command will attempt to determine the repository path using `resolveRepoPath`. If `resolveRepoPath` fails to find a repository, the command will error out with a clear message.
- Version 0.44.0  The `minsky session start` command now correctly handles the optional `--repo` argument. If omitted, it uses `resolveRepoPath` to determine the repository path. If no repository is found, it errors out with a clear message.  Added comprehensive tests covering various scenarios, including successful execution with and without `--repo`, error handling when no repository is found, and correct usage of `resolveRepoPath`.  The tests now use bun:test's mocking capabilities.
- Version 0.45.0 The `--repo` argument for `minsky session start` is now optional. If omitted, the command will attempt to determine the repository path using `resolveRepoPath`.  If `resolveRepoPath` fails, the command will error out with a clear message.  The `minsky session start` command's business logic has been extracted to `startSession` for better testability.  Comprehensive tests have been added for `startSession` using bun:test mocking capabilities to cover various scenarios, including successful execution with and without `--repo`, error handling when no repository is found, and correct usage of `resolveRepoPath`.
- Version 0.46.0 The `minsky session start` command's business logic has been extracted to `startSession` for better testability. Comprehensive tests have been added for `startSession`, covering various scenarios, including successful execution with and without `--repo`, error handling when no repository is found, and correct usage of `resolveRepoPath`. The tests use Bun's mocking capabilities.  A positive test case was added for the fallback scenario where `resolveRepoPath` returns a valid path.
- Version 0.47.0  The `--repo` argument is now optional for `minsky session start`. If omitted, the command attempts to use the current git repository root via `resolveRepoPath`. If neither a repo nor a session is provided and `resolveRepoPath` fails, the command errors out with a clear message. The `minsky session start` command's business logic has been extracted to `startSession` for better testability.  Comprehensive tests have been added for `startSession`, covering various scenarios, including successful execution with and without `--repo`, error handling when no repository is found, and correct usage of `resolveRepoPath`.  The tests use Bun's mocking capabilities.
- Version 0.48.0 Added tests for startSession command.  The tests utilize Bun's mocking capabilities to isolate and test the core logic.  The tests cover various scenarios, including successful execution with and without the --repo flag, error handling when no repository is found, and the correct usage of resolveRepoPath.  All tests pass.
- Version 0.49.0 Updated `startSession` to accept dependencies via parameters, enabling direct dependency injection in tests.  Updated tests to inject mocks directly, avoiding `mock.module`. All tests pass.
- Version 0.50.0 Added a positive test case for the fallback scenario where `resolveRepoPath` returns a valid path in `startSession.test.ts`. All tests pass.
- Version 0.51.0 Added support for associating sessions with tasks via the `--task <taskId>` option in `session start` command. The task ID is stored in the session record and used to generate the session name. Enhanced error handling to validate task existence and prevent duplicate sessions for the same task. Updated all relevant tests. _See: SpecStory history [2025-04-28_16-22-backlog-task-inquiry](.specstory/history/2025-04-28_16-22-backlog-task-inquiry.md) for implementation details._
- Version 0.52.0 Improved the minsky-workflow.mdc documentation to address feedback from junior engineer simulations.  Clarified task ID formatting, added instructions for handling JSON output using jq, clarified session name requirements, improved session start output, added instructions for updating the changelog and task spec, and clarified the use of IN-REVIEW and DONE task statuses.  Added a new task to add the task spec document path to the minsky tasks get command output.
- Version 0.53.0 Updated instructions for finding existing sessions to use `minsky session get` instead of listing and filtering with `jq`. Added task #004 to add a `--task` option to `session get` to query sessions by task ID.
- Version 0.54.0 Added task #005 to add a `minsky git push` command.
- Version 0.55.0 Added task #006 to improve the output of the `session start` command for programmatic use cases.
- Version 0.56.0 Updated minsky-workflow.mdc to reflect changes from task #006.


## DEBUGGING

- Use `console.log` for debugging purposes.  Remove or comment out debug statements before committing.


## CURSOR RULES

### command-organization.mdc
```
---
description: Command organization rules for the minsky CLI
globs: ["src/commands/**/*.ts"]
alwaysApply: true
---

# Command Organization Rules

## Directory Structure
- Each subcommand should be in its own directory under `src/commands/<command-name>/`
- Example: `src/commands/git/clone.ts` for the git clone command
- Main command files should be named `index.ts` in their respective directories

## Module Organization
- Business logic should be in domain modules under `src/domain/`
- Command modules should only handle CLI concerns (options, environment, output)
- Example: Business logic in `src/domain/git.ts`, CLI handling in `src/commands/git/clone.ts` 
```

### module-organization.mdc

description: Module organization rules for the minsky CLI
globs: ["src/commands/**/*.ts", "src/domain/**/*.ts"]
alwaysApply: true

# Module Organization Rules

## Domain Modules
- All business logic should live in `src/domain/` modules
- Domain modules should be focused on a single domain concept
- Example: `src/domain/git.ts` for git-related business logic

## Command Modules
Command modules should only handle:
- Parsing command-line arguments and options
- Setting up the environment
- Calling domain modules
- Formatting and displaying output
- Error handling and exit codes

Example: `src/commands/git/clone.ts` should only handle CLI concerns while delegating actual git operations to `src/domain/git.ts`
```

# Minsky Workflow

This rule defines the comprehensive process for working with tasks using the Minsky tool. All code changes must follow this process to maintain consistency and quality.

## Task Selection and Initial Setup

When asked to work on a task (by name, description, or ID):

1. **Find or Access the Task**
   - If you already know the task ID (e.g., "001" or "#001"):
     ```bash
     # Get direct information about a specific task
     minsky tasks get '#001' --json
     ```
   - If you need to find a task from the backlog:
     ```bash
     # List all tasks and filter with jq (never use grep for JSON)
     minsky tasks list --json | jq '.[] | select(.title | contains("keyword"))'
     ```
     > **Note:** Always use `jq` for JSON parsing, not `grep`. This is a general best practice for all projects.

2. **Check Task Status**
   - Before starting any work, check the current status of the task:
     ```bash
     minsky tasks status get '#001'
     ```
   - Task status meanings:
     - `TODO`: Not started, available to work on
     - `IN-PROGRESS`: Work has begun but is not complete
     - `IN-REVIEW`: Work is complete and awaiting review
     - `DONE`: Work is complete, reviewed, and merged
   - If the task is already marked as `DONE` or `IN-REVIEW`, confirm with the user before proceeding.

3. **Understand Requirements**
   - Read the task specification document shown in the output of `minsky tasks get`
   - The path is typically `process/tasks/<task-id>-<task-name>.md` (e.g., `process/tasks/001-update-session-start.md`)
   - Ensure all requirements and acceptance criteria are clearly understood
   - Note any dependencies or blocking issues

## Session Management

### Starting a New Session

1. **Create a Task Session**
   - Begin a new session for the task (no session name needed when using `--task`):
     ```bash
     minsky session start --task 001
     ```
   - The output will show:
     - The auto-generated session name (e.g., `task#001`)
     - The repository location where files were cloned
     - The branch name that was created (same as session name)
     - The task ID association
     - Command to navigate to the session directory
     - The session directory path (for programmatic use)

2. **Enter the Session Directory**
   - Navigate to the session directory using the command provided in the previous output:
     ```bash
     cd $(minsky session dir task#001)
     ```

### Re-entering an Existing Session

When asked to continue working on a task:

1. **Find Existing Session**
   - Look up the session associated with the task:
     ```bash
     # Use session get to get details about a specific session
     minsky session get task#001
     ```
   - If you don't know the session name, you may need to list all sessions:
     ```bash
     # List all sessions and filter for the task ID using jq
     minsky session list --json | jq '.[] | select(.taskId == "#001")'
     ```
   - Note: A future enhancement will add a `--task` option to the `session get` command to directly query sessions by task ID

2. **Enter Existing Session**
   - Navigate to the session directory:
     ```bash
     cd $(minsky session dir task#001)
     ```
   - If no session exists, create one as described in "Starting a New Session"

## Implementation Process

1. **Planning**
   - Review the task document to ensure full understanding
   - For a new task, draft an implementation plan and append it to the task document
   - For continuing work, review the task's "Work Log" section to see progress

2. **Implementation**
   - Follow all project coding standards and best practices
   - Implement the required changes, addressing all requirements
   - Commit changes at logical intervals with clear, descriptive messages
   - Reference the task ID in all commit messages (e.g., "Implement feature X for #001")

3. **Work Log**
   - Maintain a "Work Log" section in the task document:
     ```markdown
     ## Work Log
     - YYYY-MM-DD: Implemented X feature
     - YYYY-MM-DD: Fixed Y bug
     - YYYY-MM-DD: Added tests for Z functionality
     ```
   - This log will be used to update the changelog when the task is complete

4. **Testing**
   - Write appropriate tests for all new functionality
   - Ensure all existing tests continue to pass

## Verification and Documentation

1. **Verification**
   - Verify that all requirements have been implemented correctly
   - Check off completed verification steps in the task document by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`
   - Ensure that all tests pass

2. **Documentation**
   - Update the task document with implementation details
   - Document any design decisions or compromises made during implementation
   - Update any relevant project documentation

3. **Changelog**
   - Follow the instructions in the [changelog rule](mdc:changelog.mdc) for updating the appropriate CHANGELOG.md
   - Use the Work Log from the task document as the basis for changelog entries
   - Reference the task ID in the changelog entry

## Task Completion

1. **PR Preparation**
   - Generate a PR description:
     ```bash
     minsky git pr
     ```
   - Minsky will automatically create necessary directories and save the PR description to:
     ```
     process/tasks/<task-id>/pr.md
     ```
   - Commit this PR description file

2. **Finalization**
   - Push your branch:
     ```bash
     # Current approach (standard git command)
     git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
     
     # Future: Will be simplified with dedicated command (Task #005)
     # minsky git push
     ```
   - Note: Task #005 is in progress to simplify this step with a dedicated command

3. **Status Update**
   - Update the task status to the appropriate state:
     ```bash
     # Use IN-REVIEW after you've generated a PR and pushed your changes
     minsky tasks status set '#001' IN-REVIEW

     # Use DONE only after the changes have been reviewed and merged
     minsky tasks status set '#001' DONE
     ```

## Important Notes

- Never skip verification steps or mark a task complete without meeting all requirements
- Always check the existing task status before beginning work
- Reference the task number in all PRs, commits, and documentation
- Maintain a Work Log in the task document to track implementation progress
- If modifications to the requirements are needed, discuss and document them in the task document
- When a task spans multiple sessions, use the Work Log to ensure continuity
- Always use jq for parsing JSON output, not grep or other text-based tools
- Minsky manages branch names, session directories, and other infrastructure—you don't need to create these manually

```

### creating-tasks.mdc
```markdown
# Task Creation Process

## Overview
All tasks and work items must be tracked using the canonical process described here. Ad-hoc or freeform task files (e.g., TODO.something.md) are NOT permitted. All tasks must be:
- Listed in `/process/tasks.md` as a checklist item
- Linked to a detailed task spec in `/process/tasks/{id}-{name}.md`

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Check for Existing Tasks
- Before starting any new work, check `/process/tasks.md` for an existing task that matches your intended work.
- If a relevant task exists, follow its linked specification.

### 2. Add a New Task
- If no relevant task exists, add a new checklist item to `/process/tasks.md` using the following format:
  ```markdown
  - [ ] Task Title @#NNN
  ```
  - Use the next available task number (NNN).
  - The title should be concise but descriptive.

### 3. Create the Task Specification
- Create a new file in `/process/tasks/` named `{NNN}-task-title.md`.
- The task spec should include:
  - **Objective**: What is the goal of the task?
  - **Task Breakdown**: A checklist of all required steps and substeps.
  - **Verification**: What must be true for the task to be considered complete?
- Use checkboxes for all actionable items and sub-items.
- Include any relevant context, links, or references.

# User Preferences

This rule documents preferences expressed by the user during interactions with the AI coding assistant.  These preferences are to be adhered to in future interactions.

## Workflow Preferences

- **Avoid unnecessary confirmation prompts:**  Do not ask for confirmation on obvious next steps in the workflow.  If the next step is clearly implied by the conversation, proceed without asking for confirmation.
- **Never ask clarifying questions if the next steps seem obvious:** If the next steps are clearly implied by the conversation, proceed without asking for confirmation.  The AI should make reasonable assumptions about the user's intent and proceed accordingly.
- **Never ask for confirmation on next steps like 'Would you like to proceed with ...?'.**
- **Always execute the next logical step when the user says 'do it, don't just tell me what to do', or similar.**
- **If a test or command fails or hangs, attempt to debug and resolve it automatically, rather than asking the user what to do next.**
- **When a workflow or troubleshooting step is implied, proceed with it directly.**
- **Prefer direct action over explanation:** When the user's intent is clear, take the action rather than explaining what you will do.
- **Document new preferences:** Add any new user preferences to this rule as they arise in future sessions.
- **When working with JSON outputs, always use `jq` for parsing and filtering, never `grep`.**

```

## README

# Minsky

A tool for coordinating AI agent workflows using Git and other collaboration tools. Inspired by Marvin Minsky's "Society of Mind" theory and organizational cybernetics.

> **⚠️ Note:** This is an experimental project under active development. Not suitable for production use.

## Overview

Minsky helps AI agents collaborate on codebases by leveraging the same tools human engineers use:

- **Git repositories** for version control
- **Isolated workspaces** for preventing conflicts
- **Branch-based workflows** for parallel development
- **Pull request summaries** for documenting changes
- **Task management** for tracking and coordinating work items

The key idea is to enable agents to collaborate asynchronously using established software engineering practices, whether they're operating in the same environment or isolated from each other.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/minsky.git
cd minsky

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Link globally
bun link
```

## Usage

### Git Commands

```bash
# Clone a repo (auto-generates session ID)
minsky git clone <repo-url>

# Clone with a named session
minsky git clone <repo-url> --session <session-name>

# Create a branch in session
minsky git branch <branch-name> --session <session-name>

# Generate PR document
minsky git pr --session <session-name> [--branch <branch-name>] --path <repo-path>
```

> **Note:** Most commands that operate on a repository support `--session <session>` (to use a named session's repo) or `--repo <repoPath>` (to specify a repo path directly).

### Session Management

```bash
# Start a new session (with optional task ID)
minsky session start <session-name> --repo <repo-url-or-path> 

# Start a session associated with a task
minsky session start --task <task-id> --repo <repo-url-or-path>

# List all sessions
minsky session list

# View session details
minsky session get <session-name>
minsky session get --task <task-id>

# Get session directory
minsky session dir <session-name>

```

### Tasks Management

Minsky supports robust, extensible task management with multiple backends (default: Markdown checklist in `process/tasks.md`).

```bash
# List all tasks in the current repo (or specify with --repo or --session)
minsky tasks list --repo /path/to/repo --json

# Filter tasks by status (TODO, DONE, IN PROGRESS, IN REVIEW)
minsky tasks list --repo /path/to/repo --status TODO --json

# Get details for a specific task by ID
minsky tasks get --repo /path/to/repo #001 --json

# Get the status of a task
minsky tasks status get --repo /path/to/repo #001

# Set the status of a task (TODO, DONE, IN PROGRESS, IN REVIEW)
minsky tasks status set --repo /path/to/repo #001 DONE
```

To query the backlog, use: `minsky tasks list --json`

**Options:**
- `--repo <repoPath>`: Path to a git repository (overrides session)
- `--session <session>`: Session name to use for repo resolution
- `--backend <backend>`: Task backend to use (default: markdown, future: github)
- `--status <status>`: Filter tasks by status (for `list`)
- `--taskId <task-id>`: Task ID to associate with session (for `session start`)
- `--json`: Output tasks as JSON


**Features:**
- Parses Markdown checklists in `process/tasks.md`, skipping code blocks and malformed lines
- Aggregates indented lines as task descriptions
- Extensible: future support for GitHub Issues and other backends
- Supports task statuses: TODO, DONE, IN PROGRESS (-), IN REVIEW (+)


## Example Workflows

### Basic Development Flow

```bash
# Start a new session
minsky session start feature-123 --repo https://github.com/org/project.git

# Get session directory
minsky session dir feature-123

# Work on code, then generate PR
minsky git pr --session feature-123 > PR.md

# List and update tasks
minsky tasks list --session feature-123 --json
minsky tasks status set --session feature-123 #001 DONE
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Multiple agents can work on related features in parallel:

```bash
# Agent 1: Authentication backend
minsky session start auth-api --repo https://github.com/org/project.git

# Agent 2: Frontend integration
minsky session start auth-ui --repo https://github.com/org/project.git
```

Each agent works in its own isolated environment and can generate PR documents to share their changes. Tasks can be listed and updated per session or repo.

## Future Plans

- Team organization patterns for agents
- Session continuity and context management
- Automated code reviews
- Task planning and allocation (with more backends)

## Contributing

This project is a research experiment in non-human developer experience. Ideas, issues and PRs are welcome!

- Version 0.29.0 Added `init` command.  Supports `tasks.md` backend and `cursor` and `generic` rule formats. Creates `process/tasks` directory structure. Writes `minsky.mdc` rule to `.cursor/rules` or `.ai/rules` depending on the selected rule format.  The `tasks.csv` backend is planned for a future release.  The `init` command will create necessary directories if they don't exist.  If files already exist, the command will prompt the user before overwriting.  CLI flags override interactive prompts.  If no flags or interactive input is given, the CLI defaults to creating `tasks.md` and writing to `.cursor/rules`.
