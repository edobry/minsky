# Bug Fixing Rule: Create Failing Tests First (2025-04-29 13:36:50)

_**User**_

create a rule that specifies that when fixing a bug to first always create a failing test that covers the behavior prior to fixing it

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create a rule for test-driven bug fixing. First, let me check the rules directory.

+ # Test-Driven Bug Fixing
+ 
+ When fixing bugs in the codebase, always follow this test-driven development workflow:
+ 
+ ## Core Principles
+ 
+ 1. **Write a Failing Test First**
+    - Before making any code changes, write a test that reproduces the bug
+    - The test should fail in the same way that the bug manifests
+    - Include relevant edge cases that may be related to the bug
+    ```typescript
+    // Example of a failing test for a bug
+    describe('calculateTotal', () => {
+      it('should handle negative quantities correctly', () => {
+        // This test should fail until the bug is fixed
+        expect(calculateTotal(-5, 10)).toBe(0);
+      });
+    });
+    ```
+ 
+ 2. **Document the Bug in the Test**
+    - Add clear comments explaining the bug's symptoms
+    - Reference any relevant issue numbers or documentation
+    - Include steps to reproduce in the test description
+    ```typescript
+    describe('user authentication', () => {
+      // Bug #123: Users remain logged in after password change
+      // Steps to reproduce:
+      // 1. User logs in
+      // 2. User changes password
+      // 3. Old session should be invalidated
+      it('should invalidate existing sessions when password changes', async () => {
+        const user = await loginUser();
+        const oldToken = user.sessionToken;
+        await user.changePassword('newPassword');
+        
+        // This should fail until the bug is fixed
+        expect(await validateToken(oldToken)).toBe(false);
+      });
+    });
+    ```
+ 
+ 3. **Verify the Test Fails Correctly**
+    - Run the test to confirm it fails as expected
+    - Ensure the failure message accurately describes the bug
+    - Document the exact error message or behavior
+ 
+ 4. **Fix the Implementation**
+    - Only after having a failing test, implement the fix
+    - Make minimal changes needed to make the test pass
+    - Avoid introducing new functionality beyond the bug fix
+ 
+ 5. **Verify All Tests Pass**
+    - Run the full test suite to ensure the fix doesn't break other functionality
+    - Check that the previously failing test now passes
+    - Verify any related edge cases
+ 
+ 6. **Refactor if Necessary**
+    - Clean up the implementation while keeping tests green
+    - Look for similar patterns that might need the same fix
+    - Update documentation to reflect the fix
+ 
+ ## Benefits
+ 
+ - Ensures the bug is reproducible before attempting a fix
+ - Prevents regression by having a test that would catch the same bug
+ - Documents the bug and its fix in a maintainable way
+ - Validates that the fix actually addresses the reported issue
+ 
+ ## Anti-patterns to Avoid
+ 
+ - **Fixing Without Testing**: Never implement a fix without first having a failing test
+ - **Incomplete Test Coverage**: Don't ignore edge cases related to the bug
+ - **Over-fixing**: Avoid making changes beyond what's needed to fix the bug
+ - **Skipping Verification**: Always run the full test suite after implementing the fix
+ 
+ ## Example Workflow
+ 
+ ```typescript
+ // 1. Write failing test
+ describe('userPermissions', () => {
+   it('should remove user access when group is deleted', async () => {
+     // Set up test scenario
+     const group = await createGroup();
+     const user = await addUserToGroup(group.id);
+     
+     // Perform the action that should trigger permission update
+     await deleteGroup(group.id);
+     
+     // This should fail until the bug is fixed
+     const permissions = await getUserPermissions(user.id);
+     expect(permissions).not.toContain(group.permissions);
+   });
+ });
+ 
+ // 2. Implement fix
+ async function deleteGroup(groupId: string) {
+   // Fix: Add missing permission cleanup
+   await removeGroupPermissionsFromUsers(groupId);
+   // Existing deletion logic
+   await deleteGroupFromDatabase(groupId);
+ }
+ 
+ // 3. Verify fix
+ // Run: bun test
+ ```
+ 
+ ## Integration with Other Rules
+ 
+ This rule works in conjunction with:
+ - **dont-ignore-errors**: Ensure all test failures are addressed
+ - **test-expectations**: Document any changes to test behavior
+ - **robust-error-handling**: Include error cases in test coverage
+ 
```

I've created a comprehensive rule for test-driven bug fixing that:

1. Establishes a clear workflow for fixing bugs using test-driven development
2. Provides concrete examples of how to write failing tests first
3. Includes detailed steps for documenting bugs in tests
4. Emphasizes verification and regression prevention
5. Shows integration with existing rules like `dont-ignore-errors` and `test-expectations`

The rule is now saved in `.cursor/rules/test-driven-bugfix.mdc` and can be referenced when fixing bugs in the codebase. The rule ensures that all bug fixes are properly tested and documented before implementation, helping maintain code quality and prevent regressions.

Let me know if you'd like me to make any adjustments to the rule or if you have any questions about its implementation!
