- - Robust Markdown checklist parser for `process/tasks.md` supporting code block skipping, description aggregation, and malformed line filtering.
- - Shared `resolveRepoPath` utility in `src/domain/repo-utils.ts` for resolving repo paths from CLI options, session DB, or git context.
- - Comprehensive domain-level tests for all `tasks` logic and repo path resolution.

  ### Changed
```

```diff
  - README rewritten for clarity and idiomatic open source style
  - All debug output is now opt-in and sent to stderr
- - Refactored code to move repo path resolution logic out of `tasks.ts` into a shared utility module.
- - Updated all `tasks` subcommands to use the shared repo path utility and support `--session` and `--repo` options.
- - Improved error handling and user feedback for invalid status values in `tasks status set`.
- - Ensured all code and tests follow best practices for modularity and separation of concerns.

The `CHANGELOG.md` has been updated to:

- Remove all duplicate entries.
- Clearly group all changes under a single `[Unreleased]` section, with each changegroup (`Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`) containing only unique, non-redundant entries.
- Add references at the top to `.specstory/.what-is-this.md` to explain the SpecStory artifact system.
- Add explicit references at the end of each changegroup to the relevant SpecStory conversation history files:
  - Project setup, CLI, and domain/command organization changes reference `.specstory/history/2025-04-26_20-30-setting-up-minsky-cli-with-bun.md`.
  - Task management and tasks command changes reference `.specstory/history/2025-04-26_22-29-task-management-command-design.md`.

This ensures the changelog is both deduplicated and traceable to the exact AI conversation histories where each changegroup originated, as requested.

If you need further refinement or want to reference additional conversations, let me know!
