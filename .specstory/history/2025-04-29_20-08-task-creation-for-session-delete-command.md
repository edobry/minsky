# Task Creation for Session Delete Command (2025-04-29 16:08:19)

_**User**_

create a task to add a `session delete` command, which deletes the session repo and removes the record from the session db

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create a task for adding a `session delete` command. First, let me fetch the task creation rules to ensure we follow the correct process.

---

### Rule: creating-tasks

**Use this when creating a new task**

```markdown
# Task Creation Process

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Task Creation vs. Task Implementation
In Minsky, "creating a task" means authoring a task specification document and adding it to the tracking system - **not** implementing the code for that task.

- When the user requests to "create a task", always produce a task specification document
- Only proceed to implementation if explicitly instructed with phrases like "implement the task" or "write the code for"
- If there is any ambiguity, confirm with the user whether they want task specification or implementation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Always Check for Existing Tasks First
- Before creating a new task, always check `process/tasks.md` and the `process/tasks/` directory for existing tasks that match the user's request
- If a matching task already exists:
  - Inform the user that the task already exists
  - Provide the task ID and title
  - Review the specification to verify it matches the user's requirements
  - Only create a new task if the existing one doesn't adequately cover the requested functionality
  - Never attempt to implement a task when only asked to create one

## Overview
All tasks and work items must be tracked using the canonical process described here. Ad-hoc or freeform task files (e.g., TODO.something.md) are NOT permitted. All tasks must be:
- Listed in `/process/tasks.md` as a checklist item
- Linked to a detailed task spec in `/process/tasks/{id}-{name}.md`

## Step-by-Step Task Creation Instructions

### 1. Check for Existing Tasks
- Before starting any new work, check `/process/tasks.md` for an existing task that matches your intended work.
- If a relevant task exists, follow its linked specification.

### 2. Add a New Task
- If no relevant task exists, add a new checklist item to `/process/tasks.md` using the following format:
  ```markdown
  - [ ] Task Title [#NNN](mdc:tasks/NNN-task-title.md)
  ```
  - Use the next available task number (NNN).
  - The title should be concise but descriptive.

### 3. Create the Task Specification Document
- Create a new file in `/process/tasks/` named `{NNN}-task-title.md`.
- The task spec should include:
  - **Objective**: What is the goal of the task?
  - **Context**: Background information and why this task is needed
  - **Requirements**: Specific, detailed requirements
  - **Implementation Steps**: A checklist of all required steps and substeps
  - **Verification**: What must be true for the task to be considered complete?
- Use checkboxes for all actionable items and sub-items.
- Include any relevant context, links, or references.

## Complete Example of a Task Specification

Here's a complete example of a properly formatted task specification document:

```markdown
# Task #007: Add `minsky task create` Command

## Context

The Minsky CLI currently lacks a streamlined way to create new tasks from specification documents. Users need to manually update the tasks.md file and ensure proper linking. An automated command would improve workflow efficiency and reduce errors.

## Requirements

1. **CLI Behavior**
   - Command signature:
     ```
     minsky tasks create <spec-path>
     ```
   - The command should:
     - Parse the provided task specification document
     - Extract the title and description
     - Assign the next available ID
     - Add a checklist item to process/tasks.md
     - Return the created task details

2. **Integration with Domain Module**
   - Use the TaskService domain module to record the task
   - Add a createTask method to the TaskService class
   - Implement createTask in the MarkdownTaskBackend

3. **Error Handling**
   - Validate that the spec file exists
   - Ensure the spec file has a valid title and description
   - Handle errors gracefully with informative messages

4. **CLI Options**
   - Support the following options:
     - `--session <session>`: Session name to use for repo resolution
     - `--repo <repoPath>`: Path to a git repository (overrides session)
     - `--backend <backend>`: Specify task backend (markdown, github)
     - `--json`: Output task as JSON

## Implementation Steps

1. [ ] Update TaskBackend interface to include createTask method
2. [ ] Implement createTask in MarkdownTaskBackend:
   - [ ] Parse the spec file to extract title and description
   - [ ] Find the next available task ID
   - [ ] Create a task entry in tasks.md
   - [ ] Return the created Task object
3. [ ] Add createTask method to TaskService
4. [ ] Create a new file in src/commands/tasks/create.ts:
   - [ ] Define command using Commander.js
   - [ ] Add appropriate options and arguments
   - [ ] Implement action handler to call domain method
   - [ ] Add proper error handling
5. [ ] Register command in src/commands/tasks/index.ts
6. [ ] Add tests for the new functionality
7. [ ] Update documentation

## Verification

- [ ] Running `minsky tasks create path/to/spec.md` successfully creates a task
- [ ] The task is added to process/tasks.md with correct formatting
- [ ] The command returns the created task details
- [ ] All options work as expected
- [ ] Error handling works correctly for invalid inputs
- [ ] Tests pass
```

## Task Type Recognition

Always distinguish between:

1. **Task Specification Requests**:
   - "Create a task for..."
   - "Add a task to..."
   - "Make a task that describes..."

2. **Task Implementation Requests**:
   - "Implement the task for..."
   - "Write the code that..."
   - "Let's code the feature for..."

When in doubt, default to creating a task specification document rather than implementing code.```

Based on the rules, I'll create a task specification for adding a `session delete` command. First, I need to check if there's an existing task for this.

I don't see an existing task for adding a `session delete` command. Let me create a new task specification. Based on the last task number I see (#014), this will be task #015.

---

```diff
  - [ ] Add `session update` command to sync session with main branch [#012](tasks/012/spec.md)
  - [ ] Add Repository Backend Support [#014](mdc:tasks/014-add-repository-backend-support.md)
+ - [ ] Add `session delete` command to remove session repos and records [#015](tasks/015-add-session-delete-command.md)
  
```

---

Now, I'll create the detailed task specification document:

---

```diff
- 
+ # Task #015: Add `session delete` Command
+ 
+ ## Context
+ 
+ Currently, there is no way to cleanly remove a session and its associated repository through the Minsky CLI. Users need to manually delete the session repository and update the session database. An automated command would improve workflow efficiency and ensure proper cleanup of session resources.
+ 
+ ## Requirements
+ 
+ 1. **CLI Behavior**
+    - Command signature:
+      ```
+      minsky session delete <session-name>
+      ```
+    - The command should:
+      - Delete the session's repository directory
+      - Remove the session record from the session database
+      - Support both successful and error cases with appropriate exit codes
+      - Provide clear feedback about the deletion status
+ 
+ 2. **Integration with Domain Module**
+    - Add a deleteSession method to the SessionService class
+    - Implement proper error handling for:
+      - Non-existent sessions
+      - File system errors during repository deletion
+      - Database errors during record removal
+ 
+ 3. **CLI Options**
+    - Support the following options:
+      - `--force`: Skip confirmation prompt
+      - `--json`: Output result as JSON
+ 
+ 4. **Safety Features**
+    - Prompt for confirmation before deletion (unless --force is used)
+    - Verify session exists before attempting deletion
+    - Ensure clean rollback if deletion partially fails
+    - Check for uncommitted changes before deletion
+ 
+ ## Implementation Steps
+ 
+ 1. [ ] Add deleteSession method to SessionService:
+    - [ ] Add method to delete session repository
+    - [ ] Add method to remove session from database
+    - [ ] Implement proper error handling
+    - [ ] Add rollback mechanism for partial failures
+ 
+ 2. [ ] Create new file in src/commands/session/delete.ts:
+    - [ ] Define command using Commander.js
+    - [ ] Add appropriate options and arguments
+    - [ ] Implement action handler to call domain method
+    - [ ] Add proper error handling and user feedback
+ 
+ 3. [ ] Register command in src/commands/session/index.ts
+ 
+ 4. [ ] Add tests:
+    - [ ] Unit tests for SessionService.deleteSession
+    - [ ] Integration tests for the command
+    - [ ] Test cases for:
+      - [ ] Successful deletion
+      - [ ] Non-existent session
+      - [ ] File system errors
+      - [ ] Database errors
+      - [ ] Force flag behavior
+      - [ ] JSON output format
+ 
+ 5. [ ] Update documentation:
+    - [ ] Add command to README
+    - [ ] Update CHANGELOG
+    - [ ] Update help text
+ 
+ ## Verification
+ 
+ - [ ] Running `minsky session delete <session-name>` successfully:
+   - [ ] Removes the session repository directory
+   - [ ] Removes the session from the database
+   - [ ] Shows appropriate success message
+ - [ ] Command properly handles non-existent sessions
+ - [ ] Command properly handles file system errors
+ - [ ] Command properly handles database errors
+ - [ ] --force flag works as expected
+ - [ ] --json flag produces valid JSON output
+ - [ ] All tests pass
+ - [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate 
+ 
```

I've created a new task (#015) for implementing the `session delete` command. The task specification includes:

1. Context explaining why the command is needed
2. Detailed requirements for the CLI behavior, domain integration, and safety features
3. Step-by-step implementation plan
4. Comprehensive verification checklist

The task has been added to both:
1. `process/tasks.md` as a new checklist item
2. `process/tasks/015-add-session-delete-command.md` as the detailed specification

The task is now ready to be implemented when needed. Would you like me to do anything else with this task?
