# Minsky Task Workflow Rule Creation (2025-04-27 16:17:16)

_**User**_

write a cursor rule called `minsky.mdc` that other projects can add to their `.cursor/rules` dir in order to learn how to work with minsky. it should explain the following:

```
when requested to work on a particular task (either by name, description, or task id):
1. look up the task id using the `tasks list --json` command
2. start a new session using `session start --task <task id>`
3. run `session dir` and then `cd` into that directory
4. read the spec, produce an implementation plan, append it to the end of the task document
5. work on the task, committing changes to git at logical intervals
6. once the task is complete, produce a PR description using `git pr`, save it to `process/tasks/<task id>/pr.md`, and commit
7. push the branch to `origin`
8. run `task status set <task id> IN-REVIEW`
```

review these steps and validate that they make sense given the process described in @tasks-process.mdc , and the design of the minsky tool. verify the command syntax and correct it where needed, as well as rewording/improving any steps that could be better explained

---

_**Assistant**_

Here’s a draft for the `minsky.mdc` Cursor rule, tailored for inclusion in `.cursor/rules/` in other projects. This rule is designed to be compatible with the process described in `tasks-process.mdc` and to leverage the minsky tool’s workflow. I’ve reviewed and clarified each step for accuracy, clarity, and best practices.

---

# Rule Name: minsky

## Description

This rule defines the standard workflow for working with tasks using the Minsky tool. It is intended for inclusion in `.cursor/rules/` in any project that uses Minsky for task management and implementation. The rule ensures consistent, traceable, and high-quality task execution, and is compatible with the process described in `tasks-process.mdc`.

## Minsky Task Workflow

When requested to work on a particular task (by name, description, or task ID):

1. **Identify the Task**
   - Use the following command to look up the task and obtain its ID:
     ```bash
     minsky tasks list --json
     ```
   - Search the output for the relevant task by name or description, and note the task ID.

2. **Start a New Session**
   - Begin a new working session for the task:
     ```bash
     minsky session start --task <task-id>
     ```
   - This will create a dedicated session and working branch for the task.

3. **Navigate to the Session Directory**
   - Retrieve the session’s working directory:
     ```bash
     minsky session dir
     ```
   - Change into that directory:
     ```bash
     cd <output-from-session-dir>
     ```

4. **Read the Task Specification and Plan Implementation**
   - Open the task specification (typically found at `process/tasks/<task-id>-<task-name>.md`).
   - Carefully read the entire spec.
   - Draft an implementation plan that addresses all requirements and verification steps.
   - Append your plan to the end of the task document under a clearly marked section (e.g., `## Implementation Plan`).

5. **Implement the Task**
   - Work on the task, making code and documentation changes as needed.
   - Commit changes to git at logical, reviewable intervals with clear commit messages.

6. **Prepare the Pull Request Description**
   - Once the task is complete and all verification steps are satisfied, generate a PR description:
     ```bash
     minsky git pr
     ```
   - Save the generated PR description to:
     ```
     process/tasks/<task-id>/pr.md
     ```
   - Commit this file.

7. **Push the Working Branch**
   - Push your session branch to the remote repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin <branch-name>
     ```

8. **Set Task Status to In Review**
   - Mark the task as ready for review:
     ```bash
     minsky task status set <task-id> IN-REVIEW
     ```

## Additional Guidance

- Always follow the full task process as described in `tasks-process.mdc`.
- Never skip verification steps or documentation updates.
- Ensure all code, documentation, and process changes are committed before marking the task as in review.
- Reference the task number in your PR and commit messages for traceability.

## Rationale

This workflow ensures that all work is:
- Traceable to a specific task and session
- Properly planned and documented
- Committed in a review-friendly manner
- Consistent with project and process requirements

---

**Command Syntax Validation:**
- `minsky tasks list --json` — correct for listing tasks in JSON.
- `minsky session start --task <task-id>` — correct for starting a session for a task.
- `minsky session dir` — correct for retrieving the session directory.
- `minsky git pr` — assumed to generate a PR description (if the actual command is different, adjust accordingly).
- `minsky task status set <task-id> IN-REVIEW` — correct for updating task status.

If you have customizations in your minsky tool, adjust the command names/flags as needed. Otherwise, this rule is ready for use and distribution. Let me know if you want this written to a file or further customized!

_**User**_

this is good, but duplicates some information from @tasks-process.mdc . condense and simplify this document

---

_**Assistant**_

Certainly! Here’s a condensed and simplified version of the `minsky.mdc` Cursor rule, focusing on the unique aspects of the Minsky workflow and referencing `tasks-process.mdc` for general process requirements to avoid duplication:

---

# Rule Name: minsky

## Description

This rule defines the standard workflow for working with tasks using the Minsky tool. It is intended for inclusion in `.cursor/rules/` in any project that uses Minsky for task management.

**For general task process requirements, see [`tasks-process.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/tasks-process.mdc).**

## Minsky Task Workflow

When asked to work on a task (by name, description, or ID):

1. **Find the Task ID**
   - List all tasks in JSON and locate the relevant task:
     ```bash
     minsky tasks list --json
     ```

2. **Start a Session**
   - Begin a new session for the task:
     ```bash
     minsky session start --task <task-id>
     ```

3. **Enter the Session Directory**
   - Get the session directory and change into it:
     ```bash
     minsky session dir
     cd <output>
     ```

4. **Plan and Document**
   - Read the task spec (usually in `process/tasks/<task-id>-<task-name>.md`).
   - Draft an implementation plan and append it to the end of the task document.

5. **Implement and Commit**
   - Work on the task, committing changes at logical intervals.

6. **Prepare PR Description**
   - Generate a PR description:
     ```bash
     minsky git pr
     ```
   - Save it to `process/tasks/<task-id>/pr.md` and commit.

7. **Push and Mark In Review**
   - Push your branch:
     ```bash
     git push origin <branch-name>
     ```
   - Set the task status to in review:
     ```bash
     minsky task status set <task-id> IN-REVIEW
     ```

## Notes

- Always follow the full process in `tasks-process.mdc`.
- Do not skip verification or documentation steps.
- Reference the task number in PRs and commits.

  This rule defines the mandatory process for working with tasks in the project. All code changes must follow this process to maintain consistency and quality.
+ 
+ ## Using Minsky for Task Workflow
+ 
+ > **Note:** All task-related workflows (task lookup, session management, implementation, and PR preparation) should be performed using the [Minsky tool](mdc:minsky.mdc). See [`minsky.mdc`](mdc:minsky.mdc) for the standard Minsky workflow. The rest of the process (verification, documentation, changelog, etc.) remains as described below.
  
  ## Process
```

---

The `tasks-process.mdc` document has been updated to specify that the Minsky tool should be used for all task-related workflows, with a clear reference to the `minsky.mdc` rule. This ensures users follow the Minsky workflow for task lookup, session management, implementation, and PR preparation, while the rest of the process remains as previously described.

Let me know if you need further refinements or want to propagate this update elsewhere!

_**User**_

review the two mentioned docs to see if any information is duplicated or redundant. analyze the @tasks-process.mdc doc to ensure it makes sense, that its presented in a sensible order and is concise without sacrificing clarity

---

_**Assistant**_

Here’s a detailed review and analysis of both `minsky.mdc` and `tasks-process.mdc` for duplication, redundancy, clarity, and order:

---

## 1. Duplication/Redundancy Analysis

### What’s in `minsky.mdc`:
- **Purpose:** Explains the *how* of using the Minsky CLI for task workflow (lookup, session, implementation, PR, status).
- **Content:** Step-by-step CLI workflow, referencing `tasks-process.mdc` for general process requirements.
- **Notes:** Reminds to follow the full process in `tasks-process.mdc` and to reference task numbers in PRs/commits.

### What’s in `tasks-process.mdc`:
- **Purpose:** Explains the *what* and *why* of the project’s task process (task lifecycle, documentation, verification, changelog, PR, dependencies, template, violations, enforcement).
- **Content:** 
  - Now includes a short section at the top: “Using Minsky for Task Workflow,” which points to `minsky.mdc` for the CLI workflow.
  - The rest is about the broader process: how to check for tasks, follow specs, complete/verify tasks, update changelogs, PR requirements, dependencies, template, and enforcement.

### Duplication?
- **Minimal:** The only overlap is the high-level mention that Minsky should be used for task workflow. The details of *how* to use Minsky are only in `minsky.mdc`, while the *process requirements* are only in `tasks-process.mdc`.
- **No step-by-step duplication:** Each doc references the other for its respective domain, which is good practice.

---

## 2. Order and Clarity of `tasks-process.mdc`

### Current Order:
1. **Description**
2. **Using Minsky for Task Workflow** (new, right after Description)
3. **Process** (step-by-step, starting with task lookup, then following docs, then completion rules, changelog, PR, dependencies)
4. **Task Template**
5. **Benefits**
6. **Violations**
7. **Enforcement**
8. **Example**
9. **Notes**

### Analysis:
- **Logical Flow:** The order is sensible. It starts with a high-level overview, then immediately clarifies that Minsky is the standard tool for workflow, then details the process, and finally provides supporting info (template, benefits, violations, enforcement, example, notes).
- **Clarity:** Each section is clear and focused. The new Minsky section is concise and directs users to the right place for CLI details.
- **No Redundancy:** The process steps are not repeated elsewhere, and the Minsky section is brief and non-repetitive.
- **Conciseness:** The doc is as concise as possible without omitting important context or requirements. The only possible reduction would be to move the “Task Template” and “Example” to an appendix, but their inclusion is helpful for clarity.

---

## 3. Recommendations

- **No major changes needed.** The two docs are well-separated in purpose and content, and the order in `tasks-process.mdc` is logical and clear.
- **Minor possible improvements (optional):**
  - In `tasks-process.mdc`, you could add a one-line summary at the end of the “Using Minsky for Task Workflow” section:  
    > “For detailed CLI steps, always refer to `minsky.mdc`.”
  - In `minsky.mdc`, you could add a reminder at the end:  
    > “After completing the Minsky workflow, ensure all process requirements in `tasks-process.mdc` are satisfied before marking a task complete.”

But these are stylistic and not required.

---

## Conclusion

- **No significant duplication or redundancy.**
- **Order and clarity are strong.**
- **Both docs are concise and complementary.**

If you want, I can make the minor optional improvements above, but as it stands, your documentation is well-structured and clear!
