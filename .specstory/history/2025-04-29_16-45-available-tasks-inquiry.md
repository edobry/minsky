# Available Tasks Inquiry (2025-04-29 12:45:28)

_**User**_

what tasks are available?

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you check what tasks are available. Let me look through the tasks directory.

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory process/tasks • **10** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `010-enhance-git-pr-command.md` |
| 📄 `009-add-git-commit-command.md` |
| 📄 `008-update-tasks-list-hide-done.md` |
| 📄 `007-add-tasks-create-command.md` |
| 📄 `005-add-git-push-command.md` |
| 📄 `006-add-quiet-option-to-session-start.md` |
| 📄 `004-add-task-option-to-session-get.md` |
| 📄 `001-update-session-start-task-id.md` |
| 📄 `003-add-init-command.md` |
| 📄 `002-per-repo-session-storage.md` |

</details>

---

Here are the available tasks in the project, ordered by their ID number:

1. Task #001: Update session start task ID
2. Task #002: Per-repo session storage
3. Task #003: Add init command
4. Task #004: Add task option to session get
5. Task #005: Add git push command
6. Task #006: Add quiet option to session start
7. Task #007: Add tasks create command
8. Task #008: Update tasks list to hide done tasks
9. Task #009: Add git commit command
10. Task #010: Enhance git PR command

Let me get more details about the most recent task (#010) to give you an example of what's involved:

---

Read file: process/tasks/010-enhance-git-pr-command.md

---

Based on the available tasks and the most recent task details, I can see that there are several tasks in various stages of development. The most recent task (#010) is focused on enhancing the `git pr` command to create GitHub PRs and update task status.

Each task is well-documented with context, requirements, implementation steps, and verification criteria. The tasks are organized in a sequential order with IDs, and they focus on different aspects of the project's functionality, from git commands to session management and task tracking.

Would you like me to:
1. Provide more details about any specific task?
2. Search for tasks with a particular status?
3. Help you start working on one of these tasks?

Just let me know what information would be most helpful!

---

_**User**_

why didnt you use minsky just now? did the description of the @minsky-workflow.mdc rule not seem relevant, why not if so?

---

_**Assistant**_

I apologize for my oversight. You're absolutely right. The minsky-workflow rule is very relevant here, and I specifically violated the automation directive which states:

> "Whenever you are asked about the current state of tasks, sessions, or any live project data, always run the appropriate `minsky` CLI command (e.g., `minsky tasks list --json`, `minsky tasks status get <id>`, etc.) to retrieve real-time information. Do not rely solely on static documentation, code, or cached data for these queries."

Let me correct this by using the minsky CLI to get the current task information:

---

```bash
minsky tasks list --json
```

```
[
  {
    "id": "#001",
    "title": "Update session start command to support task IDs",
    "status": "DONE",
    "description": ""
  },
  {
    "id": "#002",
    "title": "Store session repos under per-repo directories and add repoName to
 session DB",
    "status": "TODO",
    "description": ""
  },
  {
    "id": "#003",
    "title": "Add `init` command to set up a project for Minsky",
    "status": "TODO",
    "description": ""
  },
  {
    "id": "#004",
    "title": "Add `--task` option to `session get` command to query sessions by
task ID",
    "status": "TODO",
    "description": ""
  },
  {
    "id": "#005",
    "title": "Add `git push` command to simplify pushing branches to remote repo
sitories",
    "status": "TODO",
    "description": ""
  },
  {
    "id": "#006",
    "title": "Add `--quiet` option to `session start` for programmatic output",
    "status": "TODO",
    "description": ""
  },
  {
    "id": "#007",
    "title": "Add `minsky tasks create` command to create tasks from spec docume
nts",
    "status": "TODO",
    "description": ""
  },
  {
    "id": "#008",
    "title": "Update `tasks list` to default to not-DONE tasks only, add option
to show DONE",
    "status": "TODO",
    "description": ""
  },
  {
    "id": "#009",
    "title": "Add `git commit` command to stage and commit changes",
    "status": "TODO",
    "description": ""
  },
  {
    "id": "#010",
    "title": "Enhance `git pr` command to create GitHub PRs and update task stat
us",
    "status": "TODO",
    "description": ""
  }
]

```

---

This gives us the current, real-time state of all tasks in the system. I can see that:
- Task #001 is marked as DONE
- Tasks #002 through #010 are all in TODO status
- Each task has a clear title and ID

This is much better than my previous response which relied on static file listings. The minsky CLI provides us with structured, up-to-date information about the actual state of tasks in the system.

Would you like me to:
1. Get more detailed information about any specific task using `minsky tasks get`?
2. Check the status of a particular task using `minsky tasks status get`?
3. Help you start working on one of these available tasks?

---

_**User**_

i want to understand why the `description` of the command didnt seem relevant enough to my initial query to get you to follow it. think thru the conversation from the very beginning, including the system prompt prior to my initial ask, and walk me through it

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me walk through the sequence of events and analyze where my reasoning went wrong:

1. Initial System Context:
- I was provided with a comprehensive system prompt
- The project layout was shared
- Custom instructions were provided, including available rules
- The minsky-workflow rule was marked as "REQUIRED workflow for ANY task implementation"

2. Your Initial Query:
```
what tasks are available?
```

3. My Decision-Making Process:
- I saw this as a simple information retrieval request
- I defaulted to using standard directory listing tools first
- I focused on the static files in `process/tasks/`
- I even went further to read one of the task files in detail

4. Where I Went Wrong:
The critical oversight was in not properly interpreting this key part of the minsky-workflow rule:

> "ANY query about tasks or sessions (e.g., "what tasks are available?", "list tasks", etc.) MUST use the minsky CLI to get live data, not file listings or static documentation."

The rule explicitly used "what tasks are available?" as an example - the exact query you made. This should have been an immediate trigger to use the minsky CLI.

5. Why I Missed It:
- I incorrectly interpreted the rule's scope. Despite it being marked as "REQUIRED", I subconsciously categorized it as being primarily about task implementation rather than task querying
- I focused on the "implementation" aspect of the rule name ("REQUIRED workflow for ANY task implementation") and missed that its scope included ALL task-related queries
- I defaulted to traditional development tools (list_dir, read_file) instead of following the project's specific tooling requirements
- The automation directive in the rule is extremely clear about using the CLI for ANY task-related queries, but I failed to properly weight its importance

6. The Correct Approach Should Have Been:
- Recognize that "what tasks are available?" is explicitly mentioned in the rule
- Immediately use `minsky tasks list --json` to get real-time data
- Present that data to you
- Optionally offer to get more detailed information about specific tasks using other minsky CLI commands

This analysis reveals that I failed to properly implement the rule not because it wasn't relevant or clear, but because I:
1. Incorrectly scoped its applicability
2. Defaulted to general-purpose tools instead of project-specific requirements
3. Missed the explicit example that matched your query exactly

This is a good learning opportunity about the importance of following project-specific workflows and tools, even for seemingly simple queries. The rule was designed to ensure consistency and accuracy by always using the live system state, and I should have followed it from the start.

---

_**User**_

lets improve that rule's description to take this issue into account

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help create an edit to the minsky-workflow rule to make its scope and applicability clearer from the very beginning. The key is to make it immediately obvious that this rule applies to ALL task and session related queries, not just implementation.

---

### Rule: minsky-workflow

**REQUIRED workflow for ANY task implementation - MUST apply when task references (#XXX, task #XXX) appear in requests. Enforces session creation before code changes.**

```markdown
# Minsky Workflow

This rule defines the comprehensive process for working with tasks using the Minsky tool. All code changes must follow this process to maintain consistency and quality. ANY query about tasks or sessions (e.g., "what tasks are available?", "list tasks", etc.) MUST use the minsky CLI to get live data, not file listings or static documentation.

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: SESSION-FIRST IMPLEMENTATION

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: A SESSION MUST BE CREATED AND ACTIVE BEFORE ANY CODE CHANGES**

Before examining or modifying any code, you MUST:
1. Verify task status (`minsky tasks status get '#id'`)
2. Create or identify an existing session (`minsky session start --task id`)
3. Enter the session directory (`cd $(minsky session dir session-name)`)

No code examination or changes are permitted until these steps are complete.
Violating this rule compromises the entire workflow system.

## Request Interpretation and Workflow Priority

1. **Always interpret requests based on their literal meaning in the project context**
   - "Create a task" means creating a task specification document, not implementing code
   - "Implement" or "code" refers to writing the actual implementation
   - When in doubt, default to task specification over implementation

2. **Request Type Recognition**
   - Categorize requests as either "specifying work" or "implementing work"
   - Each category requires different response patterns:
     - Specifying work → create task specification documents
     - Implementing work → write code following existing specifications
   - Never implement code until the specification is verified

3. **When to Request Clarification**
   - If a request could be interpreted multiple ways, ask for clarification
   - Examples of ambiguous requests requiring clarification:
     - "Work on task #123" (specify or implement?)
     - "Handle the task creation feature" (create spec or code?)
     - "Add the minsky task create command" (create spec or implement?)
   - Always err on the side of creating task specifications when unclear

4. **Clear vs. Ambiguous Request Examples**
   - Clear Specification Request: "Create a task to add a minsky task create command"
     → Create a task specification document
   - Clear Implementation Request: "Implement the minsky task create command according to task #007"  
     → Implement the code following the specification
   - Ambiguous Request: "Add the minsky task create command"
     → Default to creating a task specification unless context clearly indicates implementation

**Automation Directive:** Whenever you are asked about the current state of tasks, sessions, or any live project data, always run the appropriate `minsky` CLI command (e.g., `minsky tasks list --json`, `minsky tasks status get <id>`, etc.) to retrieve real-time information. Do not rely solely on static documentation, code, or cached data for these queries. Only supplement with documentation or codebase details if the CLI output is insufficient or ambiguous. This ensures all answers reflect the actual, current state of the project.

## Task Selection and Initial Setup

When asked to work on a task (by name, description, or ID):

1. **Find or Access the Task**
   - If you already know the task ID (e.g., "001" or "#001"):
     ```bash
     # Get direct information about a specific task
     minsky tasks get '#001' --json
     ```
   - If you need to find a task from the backlog:  When asked to list, filter, or check the status of tasks, always run:
     ```bash
     minsky tasks list --json
     ```
     and present the output directly, unless specifically instructed otherwise.
     > **Note:** Always use `jq` for JSON parsing, not `grep`. This is a general best practice for all projects.

2. **Check Task Status**
   - Before starting any work, check the current status of the task:
     ```bash
     minsky tasks status get '#001'
     ```
   - Task status meanings:
     - `TODO`: Not started, available to work on
     - `IN-PROGRESS`: Work has begun but is not complete
     - `IN-REVIEW`: Work is complete and awaiting review
     - `DONE`: Work is complete, reviewed, and merged
   - If the task is already marked as `DONE` or `IN-REVIEW`, confirm with the user before proceeding.

3. **Understand Requirements**
   - Read the task specification document shown in the output of `minsky tasks get`
   - The path is typically `process/tasks/<task-id>-<task-name>.md` (e.g., `process/tasks/001-update-session-start.md`)
   - Ensure all requirements and acceptance criteria are clearly understood
   - Note any dependencies or blocking issues

## Creating New Tasks

When asked to create a new task:

1. **Refer to the creating-tasks rule**
   - See detailed instructions in the `creating-tasks.mdc` rule
   - Never implement code when asked to create a task unless explicitly instructed
   - Always create a well-formatted task specification document

2. **Checklist Steps for Task Creation**
   - Create a task specification document following the standardized format
   - Add the task to the main task list in `/process/tasks.md`
   - Use the next available task ID
   - Link the task correctly following project conventions

## Session Management

### Starting a New Session

1. **Create a Task Session**
   - Begin a new session for the task (no session name needed when using `--task`):
     ```bash
     minsky session start --task 001
     ```
   - The output will show:
     - The auto-generated session name (e.g., `task#001`)
     - The repository location where files were cloned
     - The branch name that was created (same as session name)
     - The task ID association
     - Command to navigate to the session directory
     - The session directory path (for programmatic use)

2. **Enter the Session Directory**
   - Navigate to the session directory using the provided command

### Re-entering an Existing Session

When asked to continue working on a task:

1. **Find Existing Session**
   - Look up the session associated with the task:
     ```bash
     # Use session get to get details about a specific session
     minsky session get task#001
     ```
   - If you don't know the session name, you may need to list all sessions:
     ```bash
     minsky session list --json | jq '.[] | select(.taskId == "#001")'
     ```
   - Note: A future enhancement will add a `--task` option to the `session get` command to directly query sessions by task ID

2. **Enter Existing Session**
   - Navigate to the session directory:
     ```bash
     cd $(minsky session dir task#001)
     ```
   - If no session exists, create one as described in "Starting a New Session"

## Implementation Process

1. **Planning**
   - Review the task document to ensure full understanding
   - For a new task, draft an implementation plan and append it to the task document
   - For continuing work, review the task's "Work Log" section to see progress

2. **Implementation**
   - Follow all project coding standards and best practices
   - Implement the required changes, addressing all requirements
   - Commit changes at logical intervals with clear, descriptive messages
   - Reference the task ID in all commit messages (e.g., "Implement feature X for #001")

3. **Work Log**
   - Maintain a "Work Log" section in the task document:
     ```markdown
     ## Work Log
     - YYYY-MM-DD: Implemented X feature
     - YYYY-MM-DD: Fixed Y bug
     - YYYY-MM-DD: Added tests for Z functionality
     ```
   - This log will be used to update the changelog when the task is complete

4. **Testing**
   - Write appropriate tests for all new functionality
   - Ensure all existing tests continue to pass
   - Document any complex test scenarios or edge cases addressed

## Verification and Documentation

1. **Verification**
   - Verify that all requirements have been implemented correctly
   - Check off completed verification steps in the task document by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`
   - Ensure that all tests pass

2. **Documentation**
   - Update the task document with implementation details
   - Document any design decisions or compromises made during implementation
   - Update any relevant project documentation

3. **Changelog**
   - Follow the instructions in the [changelog rule](mdc:changelog.mdc) for updating the appropriate CHANGELOG.md
   - Use the Work Log from the task document as the basis for changelog entries
   - Reference the task ID in the changelog entry

## Task Completion

1. **PR Preparation**
   - Generate a PR description:
     ```bash
     minsky git pr
     ```
   - Minsky will automatically create necessary directories and save the PR description to:
     ```
     process/tasks/<task-id>/pr.md
     ```
   - Commit this PR description file

2. **Finalization**
   - Push your branch:
     ```bash
     # Current approach (standard git command)
     git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
     
     # Future: Will be simplified with dedicated command (Task #005)
     # minsky git push
     ```
   - Note: Task #005 is in progress to simplify this step with a dedicated command

3. **Status Update**
   - Update the task status to the appropriate state:
     ```bash
     # Use IN-REVIEW after you've generated a PR and pushed your changes
     minsky tasks status set '#001' IN-REVIEW
     
     # Use DONE only after the changes have been reviewed and merged
     minsky tasks status set '#001' DONE
     ```

## Important Notes

- Never skip verification steps or mark a task complete without meeting all requirements
- Always check the existing task status before beginning work
- Reference the task number in all PRs, commits, and documentation
- Maintain a Work Log in the task document to track implementation progress
- If modifications to the requirements are needed, discuss and document them in the task document
- When a task spans multiple sessions, use the Work Log to ensure continuity
- Minsky manages branch names, session directories, and other infrastructure—you don't need to create these manually

> **Triggering the Minsky CLI for Task/Session Queries**
>
> For any user query that asks about the existence, availability, status, or list of tasks or sessions, you MUST use the minsky CLI to retrieve live data. This includes, but is not limited to, queries such as:
> - "What tasks are available?"
> - "List all tasks"
> - "Show open/in-progress/done tasks"
> - "What sessions exist?"
> - "What is the status of task #007?"
> - "Which tasks are in the backlog?"
>
> **Do NOT** answer these queries by listing files or reading static documentation. **Always** run the appropriate minsky CLI command (e.g., `minsky tasks list --json`) and present the output directly.```

Let me propose an edit to make the rule's scope and applicability clearer from the very beginning:

---

```diff

```

---

_**User**_

no, i want to update the description field ONLY

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I apologize for the confusion. You're right - we should only update the description field of the rule, which is the one-line summary at the very top. Let me make that specific change:

---

```diff
- REQUIRED workflow for ALL task and session operations - MUST apply to ANY query about tasks (#XXX, task #XXX) or sessions, whether viewing, creating, or implementing.
+ REQUIRED workflow for ALL task and session operations - MUST use Minsky CLI for ANY task/session query or operation, whether viewing data or making changes.
  
  # Minsky Workflow
```

---

The updated description now:
1. Emphasizes that the Minsky CLI must be used for ALL operations
2. Makes it clear this applies to both viewing data and making changes
3. Is more concise while maintaining the critical information
4. Removes the specific reference to task IDs which might have made it seem more implementation-focused
5. Puts the key requirement (using Minsky CLI) front and center

This should help prevent the mistake I made earlier of defaulting to file system operations for simple queries.

---

_**User**_

this doesnt seem correct, it doesnt capture what you said about implementation vs query

---

_**Assistant**_

You're right. My earlier analysis identified that I incorrectly interpreted the rule as being primarily about implementation because of its description, but the new description doesn't properly address this distinction. Let me revise it to explicitly separate the query/viewing aspect from implementation:

---

```diff
- REQUIRED workflow for ALL task and session operations - MUST use Minsky CLI for ANY task/session query or operation, whether viewing data or making changes.
+ REQUIRED workflow for BOTH querying and implementing tasks - ANY interaction with tasks/sessions (viewing lists, checking status, or making changes) MUST use Minsky CLI, not file system.
  
  # Minsky Workflow
```

---

This revision:
1. Explicitly calls out BOTH querying AND implementing to prevent the misinterpretation I made
2. Lists specific examples of queries ("viewing lists, checking status") to make it clear this applies to simple information requests
3. Explicitly prohibits using the file system to prevent the exact mistake I made
4. Maintains the emphasis that ALL interactions must use the Minsky CLI

This better addresses the root cause of my earlier oversight - the false assumption that a "workflow" rule was primarily about implementation rather than ALL interactions with tasks and sessions.

---

_**User**_

you modified the wrong part of the file, i want to only change the part right after `description: `

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I apologize for the confusion. You're right - we need to modify the rule's description metadata at the very top of the file, not the content. Let me check the current file:

---

Read file: .cursor/rules/minsky-workflow.mdc

---

I see the issue now. Let me try again with just the description metadata:

---

```diff
- REQUIRED workflow for BOTH querying and implementing tasks - ANY interaction with tasks/sessions (viewing lists, checking status, or making changes) MUST use Minsky CLI, not file system.
+ description: REQUIRED workflow for BOTH querying and implementing tasks - MUST apply when task references (#XXX, task #XXX) appear in requests. Enforces session creation before code changes.
  
  # Minsky Workflow
```

---

I apologize, but I see I'm still not quite getting it right. Let me fetch the rules again to see the exact format:

---

### Rule: minsky-workflow

**REQUIRED workflow for ANY task implementation - MUST apply when task references (#XXX, task #XXX) appear in requests. Enforces session creation before code changes.**

```markdown
description: REQUIRED workflow for BOTH querying and implementing tasks - MUST apply when task references (#XXX, task #XXX) appear in requests. Enforces session creation before code changes.

# Minsky Workflow

⚠️ **CRITICAL: ALL TASK AND SESSION QUERIES MUST USE THE MINSKY CLI**

This rule defines the comprehensive process for working with tasks and sessions using the Minsky tool. ANY operation related to tasks or sessions - whether viewing, querying, or modifying - MUST use the Minsky CLI to ensure data consistency and accuracy.

## Core Principles

1. **Always Use Minsky CLI for Task/Session Data**
   - NEVER use file listings or static documentation
   - ALWAYS use appropriate minsky commands:
     ```bash
     # For task queries
     minsky tasks list --json          # List all tasks
     minsky tasks get '#XXX' --json    # Get specific task details
     minsky tasks status get '#XXX'    # Get task status
     
     # For session queries
     minsky session list --json        # List all sessions
     minsky session get <name>         # Get session details
     ```

2. **Real-Time Data Over Static Files**
   - Task information comes from the live system, not files
   - Session state must be queried through CLI, not assumed
   - File system should never be used as a primary data source

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: SESSION-FIRST IMPLEMENTATION

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: A SESSION MUST BE CREATED AND ACTIVE BEFORE ANY CODE CHANGES**

Before examining or modifying any code, you MUST:
1. Verify task status (`minsky tasks status get '#id'`)
2. Create or identify an existing session (`minsky session start --task id`)
3. Enter the session directory (`cd $(minsky session dir session-name)`)

No code examination or changes are permitted until these steps are complete.
Violating this rule compromises the entire workflow system.

## Request Interpretation and Workflow Priority

1. **Always interpret requests based on their literal meaning in the project context**
   - "Create a task" means creating a task specification document, not implementing code
   - "Implement" or "code" refers to writing the actual implementation
   - When in doubt, default to task specification over implementation

2. **Request Type Recognition**
   - Categorize requests as either "specifying work" or "implementing work"
   - Each category requires different response patterns:
     - Specifying work → create task specification documents
     - Implementing work → write code following existing specifications
   - Never implement code until the specification is verified

3. **When to Request Clarification**
   - If a request could be interpreted multiple ways, ask for clarification
   - Examples of ambiguous requests requiring clarification:
     - "Work on task #123" (specify or implement?)
     - "Handle the task creation feature" (create spec or code?)
     - "Add the minsky task create command" (create spec or implement?)
   - Always err on the side of creating task specifications when unclear

4. **Clear vs. Ambiguous Request Examples**
   - Clear Specification Request: "Create a task to add a minsky task create command"
     → Create a task specification document
   - Clear Implementation Request: "Implement the minsky task create command according to task #007"  
     → Implement the code following the specification
   - Ambiguous Request: "Add the minsky task create command"
     → Default to creating a task specification unless context clearly indicates implementation

**Automation Directive:** Whenever you are asked about the current state of tasks, sessions, or any live project data, always run the appropriate `minsky` CLI command (e.g., `minsky tasks list --json`, `minsky tasks status get <id>`, etc.) to retrieve real-time information. Do not rely solely on static documentation, code, or cached data for these queries. Only supplement with documentation or codebase details if the CLI output is insufficient or ambiguous. This ensures all answers reflect the actual, current state of the project.

## Task Selection and Initial Setup

When asked to work on a task (by name, description, or ID):

1. **Find or Access the Task**
   - If you already know the task ID (e.g., "001" or "#001"):
     ```bash
     # Get direct information about a specific task
     minsky tasks get '#001' --json
     ```
   - If you need to find a task from the backlog:  When asked to list, filter, or check the status of tasks, always run:
     ```bash
     minsky tasks list --json
     ```
     and present the output directly, unless specifically instructed otherwise.
     > **Note:** Always use `jq` for JSON parsing, not `grep`. This is a general best practice for all projects.

2. **Check Task Status**
   - Before starting any work, check the current status of the task:
     ```bash
     minsky tasks status get '#001'
     ```
   - Task status meanings:
     - `TODO`: Not started, available to work on
     - `IN-PROGRESS`: Work has begun but is not complete
     - `IN-REVIEW`: Work is complete and awaiting review
     - `DONE`: Work is complete, reviewed, and merged
   - If the task is already marked as `DONE` or `IN-REVIEW`, confirm with the user before proceeding.

3. **Understand Requirements**
   - Read the task specification document shown in the output of `minsky tasks get`
   - The path is typically `process/tasks/<task-id>-<task-name>.md` (e.g., `process/tasks/001-update-session-start.md`)
   - Ensure all requirements and acceptance criteria are clearly understood
   - Note any dependencies or blocking issues

## Creating New Tasks

When asked to create a new task:

1. **Refer to the creating-tasks rule**
   - See detailed instructions in the `creating-tasks.mdc` rule
   - Never implement code when asked to create a task unless explicitly instructed
   - Always create a well-formatted task specification document

2. **Checklist Steps for Task Creation**
   - Create a task specification document following the standardized format
   - Add the task to the main task list in `/process/tasks.md`
   - Use the next available task ID
   - Link the task correctly following project conventions

## Session Management

### Starting a New Session

1. **Create a Task Session**
   - Begin a new session for the task (no session name needed when using `--task`):
     ```bash
     minsky session start --task 001
     ```
   - The output will show:
     - The auto-generated session name (e.g., `task#001`)
     - The repository location where files were cloned
     - The branch name that was created (same as session name)
     - The task ID association
     - Command to navigate to the session directory
     - The session directory path (for programmatic use)

2. **Enter the Session Directory**
   - Navigate to the session directory using the provided command

### Re-entering an Existing Session

When asked to continue working on a task:

1. **Find Existing Session**
   - Look up the session associated with the task:
     ```bash
     # Use session get to get details about a specific session
     minsky session get task#001
     ```
   - If you don't know the session name, you may need to list all sessions:
     ```bash
     minsky session list --json | jq '.[] | select(.taskId == "#001")'
     ```
   - Note: A future enhancement will add a `--task` option to the `session get` command to directly query sessions by task ID

2. **Enter Existing Session**
   - Navigate to the session directory:
     ```bash
     cd $(minsky session dir task#001)
     ```
   - If no session exists, create one as described in "Starting a New Session"

## Implementation Process

1. **Planning**
   - Review the task document to ensure full understanding
   - For a new task, draft an implementation plan and append it to the task document
   - For continuing work, review the task's "Work Log" section to see progress

2. **Implementation**
   - Follow all project coding standards and best practices
   - Implement the required changes, addressing all requirements
   - Commit changes at logical intervals with clear, descriptive messages
   - Reference the task ID in all commit messages (e.g., "Implement feature X for #001")

3. **Work Log**
   - Maintain a "Work Log" section in the task document:
     ```markdown
     ## Work Log
     - YYYY-MM-DD: Implemented X feature
     - YYYY-MM-DD: Fixed Y bug
     - YYYY-MM-DD: Added tests for Z functionality
     ```
   - This log will be used to update the changelog when the task is complete

4. **Testing**
   - Write appropriate tests for all new functionality
   - Ensure all existing tests continue to pass
   - Document any complex test scenarios or edge cases addressed

## Verification and Documentation

1. **Verification**
   - Verify that all requirements have been implemented correctly
   - Check off completed verification steps in the task document by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`
   - Ensure that all tests pass

2. **Documentation**
   - Update the task document with implementation details
   - Document any design decisions or compromises made during implementation
   - Update any relevant project documentation

3. **Changelog**
   - Follow the instructions in the [changelog rule](mdc:changelog.mdc) for updating the appropriate CHANGELOG.md
   - Use the Work Log from the task document as the basis for changelog entries
   - Reference the task ID in the changelog entry

## Task Completion

1. **PR Preparation**
   - Generate a PR description:
     ```bash
     minsky git pr
     ```
   - Minsky will automatically create necessary directories and save the PR description to:
     ```
     process/tasks/<task-id>/pr.md
     ```
   - Commit this PR description file

2. **Finalization**
   - Push your branch:
     ```bash
     # Current approach (standard git command)
     git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
     
     # Future: Will be simplified with dedicated command (Task #005)
     # minsky git push
     ```
   - Note: Task #005 is in progress to simplify this step with a dedicated command

3. **Status Update**
   - Update the task status to the appropriate state:
     ```bash
     # Use IN-REVIEW after you've generated a PR and pushed your changes
     minsky tasks status set '#001' IN-REVIEW
     
     # Use DONE only after the changes have been reviewed and merged
     minsky tasks status set '#001' DONE
     ```

## Important Notes

- Never skip verification steps or mark a task complete without meeting all requirements
- Always check the existing task status before beginning work
- Reference the task number in all PRs, commits, and documentation
- Maintain a Work Log in the task document to track implementation progress
- If modifications to the requirements are needed, discuss and document them in the task document
- When a task spans multiple sessions, use the Work Log to ensure continuity
- Minsky manages branch names, session directories, and other infrastructure—you don't need to create these manually

> **Triggering the Minsky CLI for Task/Session Queries**
>
> For any user query that asks about the existence, availability, status, or list of tasks or sessions, you MUST use the minsky CLI to retrieve live data. This includes, but is not limited to, queries such as:
> - "What tasks are available?"
> - "List all tasks"
> - "Show open/in-progress/done tasks"
> - "What sessions exist?"
> - "What is the status of task #007?"
> - "Which tasks are in the backlog?"
>
> **Do NOT** answer these queries by listing files or reading static documentation. **Always** run the appropriate minsky CLI command (e.g., `minsky tasks list --json`) and present the output directly.```

---

Now I see the exact format. Let me update just the description field:

---

```diff
- description: REQUIRED workflow for BOTH querying and implementing tasks - MUST apply when task references (#XXX, task #XXX) appear in requests. Enforces session creation before code changes.
+ description: REQUIRED workflow for BOTH querying and implementing tasks - ANY interaction with tasks/sessions (viewing lists, checking status, or making changes) MUST use Minsky CLI, not file system.
  
  # Minsky Workflow
```

---

This new description:
1. Explicitly states it's for "BOTH querying and implementing tasks"
2. Lists specific examples of queries ("viewing lists, checking status") to make it clear this applies to simple information requests
3. Explicitly prohibits using the file system to prevent the exact mistake I made
4. Is more direct about requiring the Minsky CLI for ALL interactions

This should help prevent the misinterpretation I made where I thought the rule was primarily about implementation rather than ALL interactions with tasks and sessions.

---

_**User**_

no, that's not right. you just added a new description line. i specifically want to edit the description in the YAML frontmatter, within the pair of `---`s

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I apologize for the confusion. You're right - we need to edit the description in the YAML frontmatter between the `---` markers. Let me check the file again to see the exact format:

---

Read file: .cursor/rules/minsky-workflow.mdc

---

I apologize, but I don't see the YAML frontmatter with `---` markers in the file. Could you help me locate the exact section you want me to edit? From what I can see, there's just a `description:` line at the top of the file, but no YAML frontmatter section.

---

_**User**_

read the file from disk manually

_**Assistant**_

I'll read the file directly from disk to see its actual contents:

---

```bash
cat .cursor/rules/minsky-workflow.mdc

# Minsky Workflow

⚠️ **CRITICAL: ALL TASK AND SESSION QUERIES MUST USE THE MINSKY CLI**

This rule defines the comprehensive process for working with tasks and sessions using the Minsky tool. AN
Y operation related to tasks or sessions - whether viewing, querying, or modifying - MUST use the Minsky
CLI to ensure data consistency and accuracy.

## Core Principles

1. **Always Use Minsky CLI for Task/Session Data**
   - NEVER use file listings or static documentation
   - ALWAYS use appropriate minsky commands:
     ```bash
     # For task queries
     minsky tasks list --json          # List all tasks
     minsky tasks get '#XXX' --json    # Get specific task details
     minsky tasks status get '#XXX'    # Get task status
     
     # For session queries
     minsky session list --json        # List all sessions
     minsky session get <name>         # Get session details
     ```

2. **Real-Time Data Over Static Files**
   - Task information comes from the live system, not files
   - Session state must be queried through CLI, not assumed
   - File system should never be used as a primary data source

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: SESSION-FIRST IMPLEMENTATION

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: A SESSION MUST BE CREATED AND ACTIVE BEFORE ANY CODE CHANGES**

Before examining or modifying any code, you MUST:
1. Verify task status (`minsky tasks status get '#id'`)
2. Create or identify an existing session (`minsky session start --task id`)
3. Enter the session directory (`cd $(minsky session dir session-name)`)

No code examination or changes are permitted until these steps are complete.
Violating this rule compromises the entire workflow system.

## Request Interpretation and Workflow Priority

1. **Always interpret requests based on their literal meaning in the project context**
   - "Create a task" means creating a task specification document, not implementing code
   - "Implement" or "code" refers to writing the actual implementation
   - When in doubt, default to task specification over implementation

2. **Request Type Recognition**
   - Categorize requests as either "specifying work" or "implementing work"
   - Each category requires different response patterns:
     - Specifying work → create task specification documents
     - Implementing work → write code following existing specifications
   - Never implement code until the specification is verified

3. **When to Request Clarification**
   - If a request could be interpreted multiple ways, ask for clarification
   - Examples of ambiguous requests requiring clarification:
     - "Work on task #123" (specify or implement?)
     - "Handle the task creation feature" (create spec or code?)
     - "Add the minsky task create command" (create spec or implement?)
   - Always err on the side of creating task specifications when unclear

4. **Clear vs. Ambiguous Request Examples**
   - Clear Specification Request: "Create a task to add a minsky task create command"
     → Create a task specification document
   - Clear Implementation Request: "Implement the minsky task create command according to task #007"  
     → Implement the code following the specification
   - Ambiguous Request: "Add the minsky task create command"
     → Default to creating a task specification unless context clearly indicates implementation

**Automation Directive:** Whenever you are asked about the current state of tasks, sessions, or any live 
project data, always run the appropriate `minsky` CLI command (e.g., `minsky tasks list --json`, `minsky
tasks status get <id>`, etc.) to retrieve real-time information. Do not rely solely on static documentati
on, code, or cached data for these queries. Only supplement with documentation or codebase details if the
 CLI output is insufficient or ambiguous. This ensures all answers reflect the actual, current state of t
he project.

## Task Selection and Initial Setup

When asked to work on a task (by name, description, or ID):

1. **Find or Access the Task**
   - If you already know the task ID (e.g., "001" or "#001"):

   - If you need to find a task from the backlog:  When asked to list, filter, or check the status of tas
ks, always run:
     ```bash
     minsky tasks list --json
     ```
     and present the output directly, unless specifically instructed otherwise.
     > **Note:** Always use `jq` for JSON parsing, not `grep`. This is a general best practice for all pr
ojects.

2. **Check Task Status**
   - Before starting any work, check the current status of the task:
     ```bash
     minsky tasks status get '#001'
     ```
   - Task status meanings:
     - `TODO`: Not started, available to work on
     - `IN-PROGRESS`: Work has begun but is not complete
     - `IN-REVIEW`: Work is complete and awaiting review
     - `DONE`: Work is complete, reviewed, and merged
   - If the task is already marked as `DONE` or `IN-REVIEW`, confirm with the user before proceeding.

3. **Understand Requirements**
   - Read the task specification document shown in the output of `minsky tasks get`

I apologize for the difficulty. Let me try one more time with the exact format and line breaks from the original file:

I apologize, but I seem to be having trouble getting the edit to apply correctly. Could you help me understand what might be wrong with my edit attempts? The file clearly has YAML frontmatter between `---` markers, and I'm trying to update just the description field within it, but my edits aren't being applied.
