feat(#148): fix CLI Bridge direct usage warnings by adding factory context

## Problem Statement

The Minsky CLI was generating 27+ warning messages during initialization:
- "[CLI Bridge] Direct usage of generateAllCategoryCommands detected. Consider using CLI Command Factory for proper customization support."
- Similar warnings for generateCommand and generateCategoryCommand methods
- These warnings appeared even when using the recommended CLI Command Factory pattern

## Root Cause Analysis

The CLI Command Factory internally calls CLI Bridge methods, which triggered "direct usage" warnings even when following the recommended pattern. The warning system couldn't distinguish between:
1. Direct usage (should warn)
2. Factory-mediated usage (should not warn)

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Enhanced CLI Bridge Methods
- Added optional context parameter: `context?: { viaFactory?: boolean }`
- Updated method signatures:
  - `generateCommand(commandId: string, context?: { viaFactory?: boolean })`
  - `generateCategoryCommand(category: string, context?: { viaFactory?: boolean })`
  - `generateAllCategoryCommands(program: Command, context?: { viaFactory?: boolean })`

### 2. Updated Warning Logic
- Suppress warnings when `context?.viaFactory` is true
- Preserve warnings for actual direct usage scenarios
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing direct usage

### 3. Modified CLI Command Factory
- Updated all CLI Bridge method calls to pass `{ viaFactory: true }` context
- Ensures factory-mediated usage is properly identified
- Maintains clean separation between direct and factory usage

## Testing

Created and executed test script confirming:
- CLI initialization produces no warnings
- All functionality preserved
- Factory pattern works correctly
- Direct usage still generates appropriate warnings

## Impact

- **Eliminates 27+ warning messages** during CLI initialization
- **Preserves security model** - warnings still appear for actual direct usage
- **Maintains backward compatibility** - existing code continues to work
- **Improves developer experience** - clean CLI startup without noise

## Files Modified

- `src/adapters/shared/bridges/cli-bridge.ts` - Added context parameter and warning logic
- `src/adapters/cli/cli-command-factory.ts` - Updated to pass factory context
