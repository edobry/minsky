/**
 * AST Codemod: Clone Operations Mock Infrastructure Fixer
 *
 * SYSTEMATIC AST CODEMOD - Clone Operations Test Mock Infrastructure
 *
 * Problem: Clone Operations tests are executing real filesystem operations
 * - Issue 1: Tests hit "EROFS: read-only file system, mkdir '/test'" - real mkdir calls
 * - Issue 2: cloneImpl dependencies (mkdir, readdir, access, rm, execAsync) not mocked
 * - Issue 3: Tests expect specific error messages but get filesystem errors
 * - Issue 4: Git command execution not properly intercepted
 *
 * This codemod:
 * 1. Adds comprehensive mock setup for all CloneDependencies
 * 2. Ensures filesystem operations are fully mocked to prevent real execution
 * 3. Updates git command mocking to simulate expected behaviors
 * 4. Aligns test expectations with mocked dependency behavior
 *
 * Target Files:
 * - src/domain/git/clone-operations.test.ts
 *
 * Strategy: Replace real dependency execution with comprehensive mock infrastructure
 */

// Since the test file already has basic mock structure, I'll use direct search/replace
// to enhance the existing mock infrastructure rather than complex AST transformation
