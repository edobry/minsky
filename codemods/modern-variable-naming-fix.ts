/**
 * Modern Variable Naming Fix Codemod
 *
 * PROBLEM SOLVED:
 * Demonstrates the new utilities framework approach for fixing variable naming issues.
 * This represents a consolidation of multiple individual codemods into a unified,
 * framework-based system with better error handling, performance monitoring, and consistency.
 *
 * EXACT SITUATION:
 * - Parameter underscore mismatches: `_param` declared but `param` used
 * - Variable declaration mismatches: `_variable` declared but `variable` used
 * - Replaces multiple individual codemods with one comprehensive solution
 * - Provides standardized behavior across all variable naming fixes
 *
 * FRAMEWORK ARCHITECTURE:
 * - BaseCodemod: Common functionality (AST management, error handling, safe transforms)
 * - VariableNamingCodemod: Specific implementation for variable naming fixes
 * - Standardized options: dryRun, verbose, includeTests configuration
 * - Built-in performance monitoring and comprehensive error reporting
 * - Safe file transformation with automatic rollback on errors
 *
 * TRANSFORMATION APPLIED:
 * 1. Parameter Underscore Mismatches:
 *    - Finds parameters starting with underscore (_param)
 *    - Checks if function body uses non-underscore version (param)
 *    - Renames parameter to remove underscore if used
 *
 * 2. Variable Declaration Mismatches:
 *    - Finds variable declarations starting with underscore (_variable)
 *    - Checks if containing scope uses non-underscore version (variable)
 *    - Renames variable to remove underscore if used
 *
 * SAFETY FEATURES:
 * - AST-based analysis using ts-morph for precise transformations
 * - Scope-aware variable usage analysis
 * - Safe file transformations with error handling and rollback
 * - Comprehensive logging of all changes applied
 * - Dry-run mode for safe preview of changes
 *
 * CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:
 * - includePatterns: File patterns to include (default: src/**/*.ts, src/**/*.tsx)
 * - excludePatterns: File patterns to exclude (default: *.d.ts, *.test.ts, node_modules)
 * - verbose: Enable detailed logging of operations
 * - dryRun: Preview changes without applying them
 *
 * ADVANTAGES OVER INDIVIDUAL CODEMODS:
 * - Unified framework with consistent behavior
 * - Better error handling and recovery
 * - Performance monitoring built-in
 * - Easier maintenance and testing
 * - Follows Task #178 AST-first principles
 * - Much less code with better functionality
 * - Standardized configuration across all codemods
 *
 * FRAMEWORK BENEFITS:
 * - BaseCodemod provides common AST project management
 * - Standardized error handling patterns
 * - Built-in file processing with safe transformations
 * - Helper methods for common operations (variable usage checking)
 * - Consistent logging and reporting across all codemods
 *
 * LIMITATIONS:
 * - Requires utilities framework to be properly maintained
 * - More complex setup than simple individual codemods
 * - Framework abstraction may hide implementation details
 * - Dependency on ts-morph library for AST operations
 * - Limited to TypeScript/JavaScript files only
 *
 * CONSOLIDATION IMPACT:
 * This codemod represents a significant evolution from individual codemods to a
 * framework-based approach. It consolidates multiple variable naming fixes into
 * a single, more maintainable solution with better error handling and consistency.
 *
 * RISK ASSESSMENT:
 * - LOW: Framework provides better safety than individual codemods
 * - LOW: AST-based analysis is more precise than regex-based approaches
 * - MEDIUM: Framework complexity may introduce new types of errors
 * - HIGH: Success depends on proper maintenance of utilities framework
