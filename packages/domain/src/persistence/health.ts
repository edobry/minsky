/**
 * Persistence Health Assessment (mt#2949)
 *
 * During the 2026-07-19 outage, `minsky-mcp` crash-looped on boot-time
 * auto-migrate and DI substituted `UnconfiguredPersistenceProvider`. Because
 * that provider lets the process boot, `/health` kept returning 200 and
 * Railway reported the deployment SUCCESS — while every DB-backed tool was
 * dead. This module is the single place that decides whether persistence
 * state should be reported healthy for liveness surfaces (`/health` and any
 * future watchdog): it distinguishes "deliberately unconfigured" (no
 * Postgres connection anywhere — the expected local/dev/offline boot path,
 * mt#2349) from "configured but unavailable" (a connection string WAS
 * configured but initialization failed — a genuine outage).
 *
 * Only the latter is reported unhealthy. This keeps a laptop without a DB,
 * and the bundle-boot-smoke CI gate (which boots with no Postgres
 * configured), from being bricked — while making a deployed, configured-but-
 * down backend fail loud instead of silently masquerading as healthy.
