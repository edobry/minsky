/**
 * Generic numeric short-id minting (`<prefix>#<n>`) — mt#2963.
 *
 * Generalizes the `mt#NNNN` monotonic-counter-over-tombstones pattern
 * (`computeNextTaskId`, `packages/domain/src/tasks/minskyTaskBackend.ts:73`,
 * mt#2205) to any entity prefix (`ask#`, `mem#`, `ws#`, ...). Consumed by the
 * per-entity foundation tasks (mt#2965 ask, mt#2966 memory, mt#2967 session)
 * to mint a human-readable short id ADDED ALONGSIDE each entity's canonical
 * UUID primary key — never replacing it. See ADR-029 for the full decision
 * record and `docs/architecture/adr-029-numeric-short-ids-foundation.md`'s
 * rejected alternatives (replace-PK, random base58/62).
 *
 * ## Scoping — global, not per-project (single choice-point)
 *
 * The counter is a GLOBAL sequence per entity-type prefix — mirroring the
 * existing global `mt#N` task counter — NOT scoped per project. This is the
 * settled working decision from mt#2391 (Phase 1 project scoping keeps
 * global `mt#N`, using `project_id` for filtering only) and mt#2390
 * (deliberately defers the global-vs-per-project numbering question; global
 * is the no-regret, no-migration default).
 *
 * `nextShortId` takes `liveIds` / `tombstoneIds` as flat arrays with NO
 * project dimension — the caller is responsible for querying ALL rows for
 * the given prefix, across every project, when building those arrays. This
 * function's signature IS the single localized choice-point for scoping: if
 * a future per-project switch is ever adopted (mt#2390), only the caller's
 * query (which rows get passed in) changes — this function's contract does
 * not need to change, and every per-entity minting callsite that goes
 * through it inherits the switch for free.
 *
 * ## Tombstone-awareness
 *
 * The next id is `<prefix>#<max + 1>`, where `max` is taken over BOTH live
 * ids AND a per-entity tombstone set (ids of deleted rows). Including
 * tombstones is what makes allocation monotonic: deleting the
 * highest-numbered row never lowers the max, so a freed id is never
 * reissued to a new row. This mirrors `computeNextTaskId`'s
 * `deleted_task_ids` tombstone table (mt#2205); each per-entity task is
 * expected to add an analogous tombstone mechanism before wiring
 * minting-on-create for its entity.
 *
 * ## Concurrency
 *
 * `nextShortId` is a pure function (no I/O) — it does not itself guarantee
 * uniqueness under concurrent callers proposing an id from the same stale
 * snapshot. The established Minsky pattern (mirrored from
 * `MinskyTaskBackend.createTaskFromTitleAndSpec` / `tryInsertTask`) is:
 * propose an id via this function, attempt the INSERT with
 * `onConflictDoNothing()` against a UNIQUE INDEX on the `short_id` column
 * (see `short-id-column.ts`), and retry (re-propose + re-insert) on
 * collision, bounded to a small number of attempts (5, matching the task
 * backend). A TOCTOU race between the max-id read and the INSERT is
 * possible but self-heals via retry — exactly as it does for `mt#NNNN`
 * today. A DB advisory lock was considered and rejected: it would be new
 * infrastructure duplicating a pattern already proven correct for a
 * low-contention path (entity creation is not a hot loop).
