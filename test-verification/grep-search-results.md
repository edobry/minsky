# grep_search Tool Reverse Engineering Results

## Test Case 1: Basic Text Search

**Input Parameters:**

```json
{
  "query": "DatabaseConnection"
}
```

**Expected Behavior:** Should find all occurrences of "DatabaseConnection" in the workspace

**Actual Cursor Output:**

```
File: file:///Users/edobry/Projects/minsky/test-verification/cursor-behavior-analysis.ts
Line 10: export class DatabaseConnection {

File: file:///Users/edobry/Projects/minsky/test-verification/cursor-behavior-analysis.ts
Line 10: export class DatabaseConnection {
```

**Notes:**

- Returns file:// URLs with absolute paths
- Shows line numbers with "Line X:" format
- Shows duplicate results (potential bug or different match types)
- No context lines shown by default
- Searches across entire workspace by default

## Test Case 2: Regex Pattern with Wildcards

**Input Parameters:**

```json
{
  "query": "async.*connect.*Promise"
}
```

**Expected Behavior:** Should find lines matching async functions with "connect" and "Promise"

**Actual Cursor Output:**

```
File: file:///Users/edobry/Projects/minsky/test-verification/cursor-behavior-analysis.ts
Line 24: async connect(maxRetries: number = 3): Promise<boolean> {
Line 40: private async performConnection(): Promise<void> {
Line 50: async disconnect(): Promise<void> {
```

**Notes:**

- Supports regex wildcards (.\*) properly
- Still shows duplicate results for same file
- Line content is included in output
- Matches are highlighted/identified correctly

## Test Case 3: OR Operator in Regex

**Input Parameters:**

```json
{
  "query": "TODO|FIXME|NOTE"
}
```

**Expected Behavior:** Should find lines containing any of these comment keywords

**Actual Cursor Output:**

```
File: file:///Users/edobry/Projects/minsky/src/domain/tasks.ts
Line 430: status: TASK_STATUS.TODO,
...
[Multiple results across many files]
...
NOTE: More results are available, but aren't shown here. If you need to, please refine the search query or restrict the scope.
```

**Notes:**

- Supports OR operator with pipe (|) syntax
- Shows results from across entire workspace
- Has result limit with message "More results are available"
- Provides guidance to "refine the search query or restrict the scope"
- Shows both complete matches and results count limiting behavior
