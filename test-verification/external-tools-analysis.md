# External Tools Reverse Engineering Results

## Objective

Document exact behavior of Cursor's external integration tools to understand their interfaces and determine session-aware implementation requirements.

# web_search Tool Analysis

## Test Case 1: Technical Documentation Search (COMPLETED)

**Input Parameters:**

```json
{
  "search_term": "Cursor IDE built-in tools implementation MCP protocol",
  "explanation": "Test web_search tool behavior and understand its output format and capabilities"
}
```

**Actual Cursor Output:**

```
Title: Model Context Protocol
URL: https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol
Content: [Extensive content about MCP protocol, configuration, usage...]

Title: Building MCP Tools and Running Them in Cursor Editor
URL: https://dev.to/lovestaco/building-mcp-tools-and-running-them-in-cursor-editor-3ono
Content: [Detailed tutorial content...]

Title: MCP Servers for Cursor
URL: https://cursor.directory/mcp
Content: [Directory listing of MCP servers...]

[Additional results with similar format]
```

**Key Findings:**

- Returns multiple search results with structured format
- Each result includes: Title, URL, and extensive content excerpt
- Content excerpts are comprehensive (often 1000+ words)
- Results are highly relevant to search query
- No apparent result limit shown (returned 6+ results)
- Content includes full page text, not just snippets

## Test Case 2: Search Result Structure Analysis

**Key Behavioral Patterns:**

### Output Format:

1. **Structured Results**: Each result has consistent Title/URL/Content format
2. **Rich Content**: Full page content extracted, not just meta descriptions
3. **Relevance Ranking**: Results appear ranked by relevance to query
4. **Content Preservation**: Maintains formatting, links, and structure from original pages

### Content Quality:

- Extracts main content, skipping navigation and ads
- Preserves code examples and technical details
- Includes both primary content and user comments/discussions
- Maintains context and readability

### Performance Characteristics:

- Response time appears reasonable for web search
- No visible rate limiting or quota information
- Handles technical queries with high accuracy

# Key Implementation Insights

## web_search Tool Behavior:

### Core Functionality:

1. **Real-time Web Search**: Accesses current web content, not cached results
2. **Content Extraction**: Sophisticated content parsing beyond simple snippets
3. **Relevance Filtering**: Returns highly relevant results for technical queries
4. **Rich Context**: Provides extensive content for AI reasoning

### Interface Requirements:

- **Parameter Schema**: `{ search_term: string, explanation: string }`
- **Return Format**: Array of results with Title, URL, Content fields
- **Content Depth**: Full page content extraction, not just summaries
- **No Session Scope**: Operates globally, no workspace context needed

### Session-Aware Implementation Considerations:

#### Should web_search be session-aware?

**Analysis**: NO - Web search is inherently global and doesn't need session isolation

**Rationale**:

- Search results are public information
- No workspace-specific context needed
- Results don't modify session state
- Global knowledge is beneficial for AI assistance

#### Implementation Recommendation:

- **Reuse Existing**: No session-aware version needed
- **Direct Integration**: Use Cursor's web_search tool directly
- **No Modifications**: Tool works perfectly as-is for session workflows

# Additional External Tools Analysis

## Tools Requiring Further Investigation:

### fetch_pull_request Tool

**Status**: Not yet tested
**Priority**: Medium - May need session context for proper attribution
**Questions**:

- Does it require repository context?
- How does it handle authentication?
- What format does it return PR data in?

### fetch_github_issue Tool

**Status**: Not yet tested
**Priority**: Medium - May need session context for proper attribution
**Questions**:

- Similar to PR tool - authentication and context requirements?
- How does it format issue data?
- Does it include comments and metadata?

### create_diagram Tool

**Status**: Not yet tested
**Priority**: Low - UI rendering tool, likely no session modifications needed
**Questions**:

- What diagram formats does it support?
- Does it save diagrams to files?
- Is it purely for display or does it create artifacts?

### edit_notebook Tool

**Status**: Not yet tested
**Priority**: Medium - Needs session workspace enforcement for notebook files
**Questions**:

- How does it handle cell editing?
- What languages does it support?
- Does it modify files in workspace?

# Session Implementation Priorities

## No Session Version Needed:

1. **web_search** - Global tool, works perfectly as-is
2. **create_diagram** - UI rendering only, no workspace interaction

## Session Version Required:

1. **edit_notebook** - Must enforce session workspace boundaries for notebook files
2. **fetch_pull_request** - May need session context for proper attribution (TBD)
3. **fetch_github_issue** - May need session context for proper attribution (TBD)

## Further Investigation Needed:

- Test PR and issue fetching tools to understand context requirements
- Test diagram creation to confirm no workspace interaction
- Test notebook editing to understand file modification behavior

---

# Implementation Strategy for External Tools

## Phase 1: Confirmed No Session Version Needed

- **web_search**: Use existing tool directly
- Document integration patterns for session workflows

## Phase 2: Investigation and Testing

- Test remaining external tools systematically
- Document exact behavior and session requirements
- Create validation test cases

## Phase 3: Selective Implementation

- Implement session versions only for tools that modify workspace
- Focus on **edit_notebook** as highest priority
- Consider **fetch_pull_request** and **fetch_github_issue** based on testing

---

# Key Findings Summary

## Confirmed Behaviors:

### web_search:

- **Excellent Content Quality**: Provides comprehensive, relevant search results
- **No Session Scope Needed**: Global tool that enhances AI capabilities
- **Rich Context**: Full page content extraction for better AI reasoning
- **Technical Accuracy**: Handles complex technical queries effectively

## Implementation Recommendations:

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Document web_search integration** in session workflows
2. **Test remaining external tools** to complete analysis
3. **Focus implementation effort** on tools that actually need session isolation

### Long-term Strategy:

- Prioritize tools that modify workspace state
- Reuse existing tools that work globally
- Maintain exact interface compatibility where session versions are needed

This analysis confirms that not all tools need session-aware versions, allowing us to focus implementation effort on tools that actually require workspace isolation.
