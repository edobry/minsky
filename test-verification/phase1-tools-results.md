# Phase 1 Tools Reverse Engineering Results

## Objective

Document exact behavior of Cursor's `edit_file`, `search_replace`, and `reapply` tools to validate our session-aware implementations and create comprehensive test cases.

---

# edit_file Tool Analysis

## Test Case 1: Simple Code Addition

**Input Parameters:**

```json
{
  "target_file": "test-verification/cursor-behavior-analysis.ts",
  "instructions": "Add a simple console.log statement at the end of the DatabaseConnection constructor",
  "code_edit": "    constructor(connectionString: string) {\n        this.connectionString = connectionString;\n        console.log('DatabaseConnection created');\n    }"
}
```

**Expected Behavior:** Should add the console.log line to the constructor

**Actual Cursor Output:**
✅ Successfully added console.log line to constructor

- Tool correctly identified the constructor context
- Added the line at the end of the constructor body
- Maintained proper indentation and formatting
- No errors or conflicts

**Notes:**

- `edit_file` works with targeted code replacement
- Does not require `// ... existing code ...` for simple additions
- Maintains TypeScript formatting standards

## Test Case 2: Using "// ... existing code ..." Pattern

**Input Parameters:**

```json
{
  "target_file": "test-verification/cursor-test-copy-1.ts",
  "instructions": "Add validation to the query method with proper existing code markers",
  "code_edit": "  async query(...): Promise<unknown[]> {\n    if (!this.isConnected) {\n      throw new Error(\"Database not connected\");\n    }\n\n    // Validate SQL input\n    if (!sql || sql.trim().length === 0) {\n      throw new Error(\"SQL query cannot be empty\");\n    }\n\n    // ... existing code ...\n\n    return [];\n  }"
}
```

**Actual Cursor Output:**
✅ Successfully processed `// ... existing code ...` pattern

- Correctly identified the insertion point within existing method
- Preserved all existing logic between validation and return
- Added new validation code at the proper location
- Pattern recognition worked as expected

**Notes:**

- `// ... existing code ...` is properly recognized and processed
- Tool maintains existing code structure and logic
- Insertion point is intelligently determined based on context

## Test Case 3: Multiple Code Sections with Existing Code Pattern

**Input Parameters:**

```json
{
  "target_file": "test-verification/cursor-test-copy-1.ts",
  "instructions": "Add error handling to the connect method using existing code pattern"
}
```

**Actual Cursor Output:**
⚠️ Pattern not fully matched as expected

- Tool made changes but not exactly as specified in the edit
- Modified the error throwing logic instead of wrapping with try-catch
- Shows pattern matching has limitations with complex contexts

**Notes:**

- `edit_file` pattern matching can be imprecise with ambiguous contexts
- Tool makes "best effort" changes when exact pattern isn't found
- Need to be very specific with code context for reliable results

# search_replace Tool Analysis

## Test Case 1: Simple String Replacement

**Input Parameters:**

```json
{
  "file_path": "test-verification/cursor-test-copy-1.ts",
  "old_string": "console.log(\"DatabaseConnection created\");",
  "new_string": "console.log(\"DatabaseConnection initialized with:\", connectionString);"
}
```

**Actual Cursor Output:**
❌ Initial failure - quoted strings not exactly matched
✅ Success after adjusting quotes to match file format

- Tool requires EXACT string matching including quote styles
- Double quotes in file must match double quotes in search
- Single character differences cause complete failure

**Notes:**

- `search_replace` is extremely strict about exact matching
- Quote style, whitespace, and formatting must be perfect
- Provides helpful fuzzy match suggestions when exact match fails

## Test Case 2: Multi-line Context Replacement

**Input Parameters:**

```json
{
  "file_path": "test-verification/cursor-test-copy-1.ts",
  "old_string": "    // Validate SQL input\n    if (!sql || sql.trim().length === 0) {\n      throw new Error(\"SQL query cannot be empty\");\n    }\n\n    const { timeout = 5000, retries = 1, logQuery = false } = options;",
  "new_string": "    // Validate SQL input\n    if (!sql || sql.trim().length === 0) {\n      throw new Error(\"SQL query cannot be empty\");\n    }\n\n    // Check for dangerous SQL operations\n    const dangerousPatterns = ['DROP', 'DELETE', 'TRUNCATE'];\n    const upperSql = sql.toUpperCase();\n    if (dangerousPatterns.some(pattern => upperSql.includes(pattern))) {\n      console.warn('Potentially dangerous SQL operation detected:', sql);\n    }\n\n    const { timeout = 5000, retries = 1, logQuery = false } = options;"
}
```

**Actual Cursor Output:**
✅ Successfully replaced multi-line context

- Correctly identified and replaced the entire context block
- Maintained formatting and indentation across multiple lines
- Added new code section in the middle of existing logic
- No issues with line breaks or whitespace

**Notes:**

- `search_replace` handles multi-line replacements well
- Context matching is reliable when strings are exact
- Good for surgical insertions in the middle of existing code
- Tool correctly maintains formatting consistency

## Test Case 3: Unique String Requirement

**Input Parameters:**
Testing with ambiguous/non-unique strings...

**Actual Cursor Output:**

- `search_replace` appears to replace only the FIRST occurrence found
- No built-in protection against multiple matches
- User must ensure the old_string is unique within the file

**Notes:**

- Critical requirement: old_string must be unique in the file
- Tool doesn't warn about multiple potential matches
- Responsibility is on user to provide sufficient context for uniqueness

---

# reapply Tool Analysis

## Test Case 1: Reapplying After Ambiguous Edit

**Setup:** Made an edit that didn't apply as expected

**Input Parameters:**

```json
{
  "target_file": "test-verification/cursor-test-copy-1.ts"
}
```

**Actual Cursor Output:**
✅ Successfully applied reapply functionality

- Made additional formatting changes (quote consistency)
- Completed the previous incomplete edit by adding the disconnect method
- Shows `reapply` can complete or refine previous edits
- Applied smarter model to resolve ambiguous previous changes

**Notes:**

- `reapply` uses a more sophisticated model than the initial edit
- Can complete partial/incomplete edits from previous attempts
- Makes formatting improvements (quote style consistency)
- Helpful for fixing edits that didn't work as expected

---

# Edge Cases and Error Conditions

## Test Case: File Creation with edit_file

**Input:** Adding content to the end of an existing file

**Actual Cursor Output:**
✅ Successfully appended new function to file

- `edit_file` can add content to the end of existing files
- Properly maintains file structure and exports
- Handles new code addition seamlessly

**Notes:**

- Tool works for both modification and extension of files
- Linter errors may be introduced but tool completes the edit
- Good for adding new functions/classes/exports

## Test Case: Error Handling in search_replace

**Input:** Non-existent string search

**Actual Cursor Output:**
❌ Clear error message with helpful suggestions

- Provides fuzzy match suggestions when exact match fails
- Error message includes potential alternatives found in file
- Prevents accidental changes when target not found

**Notes:**

- Good error recovery with user guidance
- Prevents silent failures or wrong replacements
- Helpful debugging information provided
