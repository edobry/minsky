# Minsky CLI Test Fixes: Implementation Results

## Overview

We've successfully fixed several failing tests in the Minsky CLI project by implementing better test isolation, error handling, and timeout management. The goal was to make tests pass consistently, both when run individually and as part of the full test suite.

## What We've Fixed

1. **Test Helper Utilities**:
   - Created a new `src/utils/test-helpers.ts` utility module with reusable functions for:
     - Creating unique test directories with timestamps and random suffixes
     - Setting up standard Minsky test environments with proper directory structure
     - Creating standardized testing environments with consistent env variables
     - Handling subprocess output and errors consistently
     - Proper cleanup of test resources

2. **Session Tests**:
   - **list.test.ts**: Fixed by using unique test directories with random suffixes, proper environment variables, and improved error handling
   - **startSession.test.ts**: Fixed by refactoring for better dependency injection and more focused test cases
   - **delete.test.ts**: Fixed by using the test-helpers module for better isolation and error handling
   - **get.test.ts**: Fixed import paths, compatibility with Bun test API, and updated to use test-helpers for better isolation
   - **dir.test.ts** (formerly cd.test.ts): Renamed and updated to use the test-helpers module with proper path handling

3. **Tasks Tests**:
   - **list.test.ts**: Fixed linter errors and improved subprocess error handling
   - **create.test.ts**: Fixed Commander library mocking issues by creating a simplified test approach that doesn't rely on accessing Commander's internals
   - Updated tests to use the correct `--workspace` parameter instead of `--repo`

4. **General Test Improvements**:
   - Removed Jest-specific code not compatible with Bun's test environment
   - Fixed linter errors related to type safety
   - Improved error handling in subprocess execution
   - Added proper test cleanup
   - Fixed `.not.toContain()` assertions that don't work in Bun

## Remaining Issues

When running the full test suite with `bun test --timeout 10000`, we still have the following categories of failing tests:

1. **Session Database Issues**:
   - Tests failing with "Session not found" or "No session found for task ID" errors
   - These failures are likely due to the test database being created but not properly read by the commands
   
2. **Path Resolution Issues**:
   - Many session path-related tests fail because they can't find the correct session path
   - This appears to be related to the session database and repository setup in the test environment
   
3. **Task Tests Issues**:
   - Several tasks/list.test.ts tests fail with empty outputs
   - The tasks list functionality might not be properly looking up the test task files

## Recommendations for Full Resolution

1. **Session Database Initialization**:
   - Ensure the SessionDB is properly initialized in all test environments
   - Check for correct path permissions and database file creation
   - Verify the mock data is consistently included in the database

2. **Path Resolution Consistency**:
   - Create a standardized approach to test session paths across all session tests
   - Consider simplifying the environment variable management and path resolution
   - Use the test-helpers module consistently in all session-related tests

3. **Better Session Mocking**:
   - Replace direct SessionDB testing with a more robust mock approach that simulates the DB
   - Create a fully in-memory SessionDB implementation for testing

4. **Run Tests Individually First**:
   - Continue getting individual tests working before trying to fix them as part of the full test suite
   - This helps isolate issues that might be related to test interference

## Sample Commands

Test an individual file with timeout:
```
bun test src/commands/session/list.test.ts --timeout 10000
```

Run tests in a specific directory:
```
bun test src/commands/session --timeout 10000
```

Run the full test suite with timeout:
```
bun test --timeout 10000
```

## Conclusion

We've made significant progress in fixing the Minsky CLI tests by creating a standardized test-helpers module and fixing many of the individual test files. The patterns we've established can be applied to fix the remaining issues.

The primary challenge for the remaining failing tests appears to be session database management across tests. A focused effort on standardizing database initialization, path resolution, and environment setup would likely resolve the remaining issues.
