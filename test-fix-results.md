# Minsky CLI Test Fixes: Implementation Results

## Overview

We have successfully fixed several failing tests in the Minsky CLI project by implementing better test isolation, error handling, and timeout management. The goal was to make all tests pass consistently, both when run individually and as part of the full test suite.

## Fixed Issues

1. **Session Tests**:
   - **list.test.ts**: Fixed by using unique test directories with random suffixes, proper environment variables, and improved subprocess error handling
   - **startSession.test.ts**: Fixed by refactoring the test to use simplified mocks and proper error handling

2. **Test Helper Module**:
   - Created a new `test-helpers.ts` utility module with reusable functions for:
     - Creating unique test directories
     - Setting up standard Minsky test environments with proper directory structure
     - Creating standardized testing environments
     - Handling subprocess output and errors consistently

3. **General Test Improvements**:
   - Removed Jest-specific code like `jest.setTimeout()` and `jest.resetModules()`
   - Added better error checking for subprocess execution
   - Standardized environment variables across tests
   - Increased timeouts using Bun's `--timeout` flag

## Remaining Issues

1. **tasks/list.test.ts**:
   - Still fails in the full test suite but passes when run individually
   - Issues appear to be with process execution and workspace paths

2. **tasks/create.test.ts**:
   - Fails with errors related to Commander library and readonly properties
   - Needs a more comprehensive mock of the Commander library

3. **session/cd.test.ts** (now dir.test.ts):
   - Fails with path resolution errors
   - May need updates to match implementation changes

4. **session/delete.test.ts**:
   - Has lint errors related to ensureValidCommandResult typing
   - Needs to be fully updated to match the test helper pattern

5. **session/get.test.ts**:
   - Module import errors suggesting API changes

## Recommendations for Remaining Work

1. **Complete Migration to Test Helpers**:
   - Update all test files to use the new `test-helpers.ts` module for consistency
   - Fix type issues in the helper module

2. **Fix Commander Mocking**:
   - For tasks/create.test.ts, create proper mocks for the Commander library
   - Consider using a different approach to test command implementations

3. **Path Resolution**:
   - Ensure all tests use consistent path handling and environment variables
   - Fix the session/cd.test.ts file to handle the directory path changes

4. **Module Updates**:
   - Fix the session/get.test.ts import errors by updating the API references

5. **Test Suite Organization**:
   - Consider adding test tags to separate slow or filesystem-intensive tests
   - Implement a test suite setup file that sets common environment variables

6. **Run Tests with Verbose Output**:
   - When debugging specific test failures, use the `--verbose` flag to see more details

## Sample Commands

Test a specific file with increased timeout:
```
bun test src/commands/session/list.test.ts --timeout 10000
```

Run multiple test files:
```
bun test src/commands/session/list.test.ts src/commands/session/startSession.test.ts --timeout 10000
```

Run all tests with standard timeout:
```
bun test --timeout 10000
```

## Conclusion

The test fixes implemented have significantly improved test reliability, especially for the session-related tests. The test framework now has better isolation between tests and more consistent error handling. The remaining issues are more specific to individual test files and command implementations rather than the test framework itself.

By addressing the remaining issues using the patterns established in the fixed files, all tests should eventually pass consistently in the full test suite.
