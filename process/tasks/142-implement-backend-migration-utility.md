# Task #142: Implement Backend Migration Utility
## Context

Users need the ability to migrate existing tasks from one backend to another (e.g., from markdown tasks to GitHub Issues). Currently, when switching from using the markdown tasks backend to github issues, there's no automated way to migrate existing tasks over.
The TaskService already has the infrastructure needed:
- Backend switching capabilities (`switchBackend()`)
- Task listing and creation across backends
- Task spec content reading
- Status management
