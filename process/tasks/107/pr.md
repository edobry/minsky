# feat(#107): Refactor GitService to Functional Patterns

## Summary

This PR refactors the `GitService` module to align with functional programming principles by separating pure logic from side effects. The implementation creates a clear separation between command generation and command execution, making Git operations more predictable, testable, and easier to reason about.

## Changes

### Added

- Created `src/domain/git/types.ts` with types for Git commands and command results
- Implemented `src/domain/git/commands.ts` with pure command generator functions
- Created `src/domain/git/executor.ts` to isolate command execution and handle side effects
- Implemented `src/domain/git/service.ts` with a functional implementation of GitService
- Added unit tests for command generator functions

### Changed

- Refactored core GitService operations to follow a functional pattern:
  1. Process inputs and validate
  2. Generate command(s) using pure functions
  3. Execute command(s) with isolated side effects
  4. Process results
  5. Return typed response

### Technical Details

- **GitCommand**: Structured representation of a git command with `command`, `args`, and `cwd` properties
- **Command Generators**: Pure functions that generate command objects (e.g., `generateCloneCommand`, `generateCommitCommand`)
- **Command Executor**: Isolated function that handles the side effect of executing commands
- **Output Parsers**: Pure functions that transform command output into structured data

## Testing

- Added unit tests for command generator functions
- Ensured all existing GitService functionality remains intact
- Verified compatibility with existing callers

## Checklist

- [x] All requirements implemented
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] Code quality is acceptable
- [x] Documentation is updated
- [x] Functional programming principles are followed (pure functions, immutability, composition)
