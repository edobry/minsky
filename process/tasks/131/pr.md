# fix(#131): Fix TypeScript Issues in DI Helpers

## Summary

This PR implements task #131, fixing TypeScript linter errors in the dependency injection helper utilities located in `src/utils/test-utils/dependencies.ts`. The changes replace explicit `any` types with more type-safe alternatives, fix interface method names to match actual domain interfaces, and update mock implementations for better type inference while maintaining full test functionality.

## Motivation & Context

The dependency injection helpers in `dependencies.ts` had several TypeScript issues:

- Explicit `any` types were used in interfaces, reducing type safety
- Mock implementations used incorrect method names that didn't match the actual domain interfaces
- Some functions had unused parameters causing linter warnings
- Tests were using incompatible mock patterns (mockImplementation on non-mock functions)

These issues were flagged by the TypeScript linter and needed to be resolved to maintain code quality and type safety standards.

## Design/Approach

The solution focused on improving type safety while maintaining backward compatibility:

1. **Replace `any` with `unknown`**: Changed explicit `any` types to `unknown` for better type safety while still allowing flexible interfaces
2. **Fix interface method names**: Updated mock implementations to use the correct method names from actual domain interfaces
3. **Use direct function implementations**: Replaced `createMock` wrappers with direct function implementations for better TypeScript inference
4. **Update test patterns**: Modified tests to use `withMockedDeps` instead of `mockImplementation` for better compatibility

Alternative approaches considered:

- Using strict typing throughout would have required extensive changes to existing tests
- Keeping the `any` types would have compromised type safety

## Key Changes

### Fixed TypeScript Type Issues

- Replaced explicit `any` types with `unknown` in interface definitions for better type safety
- Updated `DomainDependencies`, `TaskDependencies`, `SessionDependencies`, and `GitDependencies` interfaces

### Updated Mock Interface Methods

- Fixed `GitServiceInterface` mock methods to match actual interface:

<pre><code class="language-typescript">
// Before (incorrect method names)
gitClone: () => Promise.resolve(...),
gitBranch: () => Promise.resolve(...),

// After (correct method names)
clone: () => Promise.resolve(...),
branch: () => Promise.resolve(...),
</code></pre>

- Fixed `WorkspaceUtilsInterface` mock methods to use correct method signatures
- Updated `SessionProviderInterface` mock methods to match actual interface

### Improved Mock Implementation Patterns

- Replaced `createMock` wrappers with direct function implementations:

<pre><code class="language-typescript">
// Before
const gitService = createMock&lt;GitServiceInterface&gt;({
  gitClone: createMock(() => Promise.resolve(...))
});

// After  
const gitService = createPartialMock&lt;GitServiceInterface&gt;({
  clone: () => Promise.resolve({ workdir: "/mock/workdir", session: "test-session" })
});
</code></pre>

### Fixed Unused Parameter Warnings

- Prefixed unused parameters with underscore: `_taskId: string`
- Removed unused `createMock` import

### Updated Test Compatibility

- Fixed integration test in `enhanced-utils.test.ts` to use `withMockedDeps` instead of calling `mockImplementation` on regular functions
- Maintained all existing test functionality while improving type compatibility

## Breaking Changes

None. All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing test code.

## Testing

- All existing tests continue to pass: `bun test src/utils/test-utils/ --run` ✅
- Verified TypeScript linter errors are resolved: `bun run lint src/utils/test-utils/dependencies.ts` ✅
- Integration test successfully updated to use compatible patterns
- Mock implementations provide the same functionality with improved type safety

### Test Results

- All 23 tests in the test-utils directory pass
- No regression in functionality
- TypeScript linter warnings eliminated
