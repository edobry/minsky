# PR: Document and Fix Rule Sync Bug in Minsky CLI

## Changes Summary

This PR addresses Task #055, which documents and fixes an issue where updates to `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files were not reflected when using the Minsky CLI rule system. After investigation, we determined this was not actually a bug but expected behavior due to the session isolation model in Minsky. This PR:

1. Adds documentation explaining the Minsky workspace isolation model and how it affects rule files
2. Removes the "bug note" from the task-status-verification rule
3. Implements a new `minsky rules sync` command to manually synchronize rules between workspaces

## Implementation Details

- **Documentation**: Added `.cursor/rules/README.md` explaining how the rules system works with workspace isolation
- **Diagnostic Improvements**: Added debugging options to the `rules get` command to help troubleshoot similar issues
- **New Command**: Implemented `minsky rules sync` to manually sync rules between workspaces

## Testing Strategy

The changes have been tested by:

1. Running rule commands with the new debugging flags to verify correct rule loading
2. Testing the new sync command to confirm it correctly synchronizes rules between workspaces

## Suggested Reviewers

Any team member familiar with the Minsky rules system and workspace isolation model.
