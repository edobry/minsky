# Add GitHub Issues Support as Task Backend

## Status

IN-PROGRESS

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL UPDATE: Multi-Backend Architecture Required

**NEW REQUIREMENT**: Support for multiple concurrent task backends has been identified as essential for migration from local markdown backend to GitHub Issues backend. This significantly expands the scope and complexity of this task.

### Multi-Backend Architecture Changes Required

#### 1. Backend-Qualified Task IDs

**Current**: Task IDs are simple numeric strings (`"123"`, `"456"`)
**Required**: Task IDs must include backend qualification (`"md:123"`, `"gh:456"`, `"json:789"`)

#### 2. Task ID Format Specification

```
Format: <backend_prefix>:<task_id>
Examples:
- `md:123` - Markdown backend task 123
- `gh:456` - GitHub Issues backend task 456
- `json:789` - JSON file backend task 789
```

#### 3. System-Wide Impact Areas

**Session Management:**
- Session names: `task#123` ‚Üí `task#md:123`
- Session records must store backend information
- Auto-detection must handle backend-qualified IDs

**Git Operations:**
- Branch names: `task#123` ‚Üí `task#md:123`
- PR branches: `pr/task#123` ‚Üí `pr/task#md:123`
- Branch cleanup operations must handle qualified names

**File System Organization:**
- Task spec paths: `process/tasks/123-title.md` ‚Üí `process/tasks/md/123-title.md`
- Session workspaces: `/sessions/task#123/` ‚Üí `/sessions/task#md:123/`
- Backend-specific directory structures

**CLI Commands:**
- All task ID parameters must accept qualified format
- Backend auto-detection from task ID
- Cross-backend task operations

#### 4. TaskService Architecture Changes

**Current**: Single `currentBackend` with all operations routed through it
**Required**: Multi-backend routing system

```typescript
interface TaskService {
  // Route operations to correct backend based on task ID
  getTask(qualifiedId: string): Promise<Task>

  // Backend selection for new tasks
  createTask(spec: TaskSpec, backend?: string): Promise<Task>

  // Cross-backend operations
  listAllTasks(): Promise<Task[]> // From all backends
  listTasksByBackend(backend: string): Promise<Task[]>

  // Backend management
  getAvailableBackends(): string[]
  getBackendForTask(qualifiedId: string): string
}
```

#### 5. Migration Strategy Requirements

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Support unqualified IDs during transition period
- Auto-detect backend for existing unqualified IDs
- Graceful fallback mechanisms

**Migration Process:**
1. Implement backend-qualified ID system
2. Add migration utilities to convert existing tasks
3. Update all system references to use qualified IDs
4. Provide transition period with dual support
5. Deprecate unqualified ID support

### Updated Implementation Plan

### Critical Issues and Challenges

#### 1. ID Conflict Resolution

**Problem**: Same numeric ID may exist across multiple backends
**Impact**: System confusion, incorrect task routing
**Solution**: Enforce strict backend qualification, add conflict detection

#### 2. Session Name Uniqueness

**Problem**: Session names like `task#md:123` may become unwieldy
**Impact**: User experience degradation, command line usability
**Solution**: Design concise but unambiguous naming scheme

#### 3. File Path Length Limits

**Problem**: Backend-qualified paths may exceed filesystem limits
**Impact**: File creation failures, cross-platform compatibility issues
**Solution**: Use short backend prefixes, path compression strategies

#### 4. Backward Compatibility Complexity

**Problem**: Supporting both qualified and unqualified IDs simultaneously
**Impact**: Code complexity, potential bugs, user confusion
**Solution**: Well-defined migration timeline, clear documentation

#### 5. Cross-Backend Operations

**Problem**: Some operations may need to work across multiple backends
**Impact**: Complex implementation, performance implications
**Solution**: Careful API design, async operation handling

### Required Follow-up Tasks

- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for API failures and network issues

#### üîç Questions Requiring Clarification

Before proceeding with multi-backend implementation:

1. **Backend Prefix Strategy**: What short prefixes should be used for each backend?
   - `md:` for markdown, `gh:` for GitHub, `json:` for JSON file?
   - Alternative schemes (numeric, alphabetic)?

2. **Migration Timeline**: What is the timeline for transitioning to qualified IDs?
   - Immediate full transition or gradual migration?
   - Backward compatibility duration?

3. **Session Naming Strategy**: How should qualified IDs be handled in session names?
   - `task#md:123` or alternative format?
   - URL encoding for special characters?

4. **Cross-Backend Operations**: Which operations should work across multiple backends?
   - Task listing, searching, status updates?
   - Migration between backends?

### Updated Scope Assessment

**Original Scope**: Large (8-12 hours)
**Updated Scope**: Extra Large (20-30 hours)

The multi-backend requirement significantly increases complexity:
- Core architecture changes required
- System-wide ID reference updates needed
- Migration strategy and tooling required
- Extensive testing across multiple scenarios
- Backward compatibility implementation

This task now requires careful coordination with system architecture to ensure clean implementation without breaking existing functionality.

## Original GitHub Issues Implementation (Completed)
