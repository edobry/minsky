# Add GitHub Issues Support as Task Backend

## Status

IN-PROGRESS

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPENDENCY UPDATE: Multi-Backend Architecture Required

**PREREQUISITE**: Task #356 "Implement Multi-Backend Task System Architecture" must be completed before this GitHub Issues backend can be properly integrated. This task now focuses on adapting the existing GitHub Issues implementation to work within the multi-backend architecture.

### Multi-Backend Architecture Changes Required

#### 1. Backend-Qualified Task IDs

**Current**: Task IDs are simple numeric strings (`"123"`, `"456"`)
**Required**: Task IDs must include backend qualification (`"md:123"`, `"gh:456"`, `"json:789"`)

#### 2. Task ID Format Specification

```
Format: <backend_prefix>:<task_id>
Examples:
- `md:123` - Markdown backend task 123
- `gh:456` - GitHub Issues backend task 456
- `json:789` - JSON file backend task 789
```

#### 3. System-Wide Impact Areas

**Session Management:**
- Session names: `task#123` ‚Üí `task#md:123`
- Session records must store backend information
- Auto-detection must handle backend-qualified IDs

**Git Operations:**
- Branch names: `task#123` ‚Üí `task#md:123`
- PR branches: `pr/task#123` ‚Üí `pr/task#md:123`
- Branch cleanup operations must handle qualified names

**File System Organization:**
- Task spec paths: `process/tasks/123-title.md` ‚Üí `process/tasks/md/123-title.md`
- Session workspaces: `/sessions/task#123/` ‚Üí `/sessions/task#md:123/`
- Backend-specific directory structures

**CLI Commands:**
- All task ID parameters must accept qualified format
- Backend auto-detection from task ID
- Cross-backend task operations

#### 4. TaskService Architecture Changes

**Current**: Single `currentBackend` with all operations routed through it
**Required**: Multi-backend routing system

```typescript
interface TaskService {
  // Route operations to correct backend based on task ID
  getTask(qualifiedId: string): Promise<Task>

  // Backend selection for new tasks
  createTask(spec: TaskSpec, backend?: string): Promise<Task>

  // Cross-backend operations
  listAllTasks(): Promise<Task[]> // From all backends
  listTasksByBackend(backend: string): Promise<Task[]>

  // Backend management
  getAvailableBackends(): string[]
  getBackendForTask(qualifiedId: string): string
}
```

#### 5. Migration Strategy Requirements

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Support unqualified IDs during transition period
- Auto-detect backend for existing unqualified IDs
- Graceful fallback mechanisms

**Migration Process:**
1. Implement backend-qualified ID system
2. Add migration utilities to convert existing tasks
3. Update all system references to use qualified IDs
4. Provide transition period with dual support
5. Deprecate unqualified ID support

### Critical Issues and Challenges

#### 1. ID Conflict Resolution

**Problem**: Same numeric ID may exist across multiple backends
**Impact**: System confusion, incorrect task routing
**Solution**: Enforce strict backend qualification, add conflict detection

#### 2. Session Name Uniqueness

**Problem**: Session names like `task#md:123` may become unwieldy
**Impact**: User experience degradation, command line usability
**Solution**: Design concise but unambiguous naming scheme

#### 3. File Path Length Limits

**Problem**: Backend-qualified paths may exceed filesystem limits
**Impact**: File creation failures, cross-platform compatibility issues
**Solution**: Use short backend prefixes, path compression strategies

#### 4. Backward Compatibility Complexity

**Problem**: Supporting both qualified and unqualified IDs simultaneously
**Impact**: Code complexity, potential bugs, user confusion
**Solution**: Well-defined migration timeline, clear documentation

#### 5. Cross-Backend Operations

**Problem**: Some operations may need to work across multiple backends
**Impact**: Complex implementation, performance implications
**Solution**: Careful API design, async operation handling

### Required Follow-up Tasks

1. **Task ID System Redesign** (High Priority)
   - Design backend-qualified ID format
   - Implement parsing and validation utilities
   - Update all ID references system-wide

- **Test Suite**: Comprehensive test coverage for all pure functions
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for API failures and network issues

#### üîç Questions Requiring Clarification

Before proceeding with multi-backend implementation:

1. **Backend Prefix Strategy**: What short prefixes should be used for each backend?
   - `md:` for markdown, `gh:` for GitHub, `json:` for JSON file?
   - Alternative schemes (numeric, alphabetic)?

2. **Migration Timeline**: What is the timeline for transitioning to qualified IDs?
   - Immediate full transition or gradual migration?
   - Backward compatibility duration?

3. **Session Naming Strategy**: How should qualified IDs be handled in session names?
   - `task#md:123` or alternative format?
   - URL encoding for special characters?

4. **Cross-Backend Operations**: Which operations should work across multiple backends?
   - Task listing, searching, status updates?
   - Migration between backends?

### Updated Scope Assessment

**Original Scope**: Large (8-12 hours)
**Updated Scope**: Medium (4-8 hours) - Reduced due to dependency on Task #356

The scope has been significantly reduced because:
- Core multi-backend architecture will be implemented in Task #356
- This task now focuses on adapting existing GitHub backend implementation
- System-wide changes are handled by the prerequisite task
- Less architectural complexity due to foundation being laid separately

This task now requires completion of Task #356 before implementation can begin.

## Original GitHub Issues Implementation (Completed)

### üîß Technical Notes

The current implementation:

- ‚úÖ Implements all required TaskBackend interface methods
- ‚úÖ Handles GitHub API authentication with configurable tokens
- ‚úÖ Maps task statuses to GitHub issue states and labels
- ‚úÖ Supports both issue creation and updates
- ‚úÖ Includes comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ Has 100% test coverage for pure functions

The backend is **functionally complete** and ready for integration once multi-backend architecture is implemented.

## Priority

Medium (depends on completion of Task #356 first)

## Summary

Adapt and integrate the existing GitHub Issues backend implementation to work within the multi-backend task system architecture (Task #356), enabling GitHub Issues as a task backend option with backend-qualified task IDs.

## Description

**PREREQUISITE**: This task depends on Task #356 "Implement Multi-Backend Task System Architecture" and cannot begin until that foundation is complete.

Currently, a GitHub Issues backend has been implemented but only works within the single-backend architecture. This task adapts the existing implementation to work within the new multi-backend system, enabling users to:

1. Create tasks as GitHub issues with backend-qualified IDs (`gh:123`)
2. Update task status by modifying issue state and labels
3. List and filter GitHub tasks alongside other backends
4. Sync task metadata between Minsky and GitHub issues
5. Support issue assignments, labels, and milestones
6. Migrate tasks from other backends to GitHub Issues safely
