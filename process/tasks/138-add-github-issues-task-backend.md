# Task #138: Add GitHub Issues Support as Task Backend

## Status

TODO

## Priority

Medium

## Summary

Implement GitHub Issues integration as a task backend option, allowing tasks to be managed directly within GitHub repositories as issues.

## Description

Currently, Minsky supports markdown and basic GitHub backend for task management. This task involves implementing full GitHub Issues support as a task backend, enabling users to:

1. Create tasks as GitHub issues
2. Update task status by modifying issue state and labels
3. List and filter tasks from GitHub issues
4. Sync task metadata between Minsky and GitHub issues
5. Support issue assignments, labels, and milestones

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core GitHub Issues API Integration
1. **Create GitHub API Client**
   - Set up GitHub REST API client with authentication
   - Implement rate limiting and error handling
   - Add support for both public and private repositories

2. **Implement GitHubIssuesTaskBackend Class**
   - Follow the functional TaskBackend interface pattern
   - Implement all required methods (getTasksData, parseTasksData, etc.)
   - Map GitHub Issues to TaskData objects

### Phase 2: Task-Issue Mapping
1. **Status Mapping**
   - Map Minsky task statuses (TODO, IN-PROGRESS, IN-REVIEW, DONE) to GitHub issue states and labels
   - Use GitHub labels for granular status tracking

2. **Metadata Mapping**
   - Handle issue titles, descriptions, assignees
   - Support milestone and project associations
   - Preserve spec file references as issue body content

### Phase 3: CLI Integration
1. **Update Task Service**
   - Add GitHubIssuesTaskBackend to available backends
   - Update backend selection logic
   - Add configuration validation

2. **Configuration Management**
   - GitHub token authentication
   - Repository selection and validation
   - Default label/milestone configuration

### Phase 4: Error Handling & Polish
1. **Robust Error Handling**
   - API rate limiting
   - Network connectivity issues
   - Authentication failures
   - Repository access permissions

2. **Testing & Documentation**
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests with GitHub API
   - Documentation and examples

## Requirements

### Core Features

- [ ] Implement GitHub Issues API integration
- [ ] Create task-to-issue mapping functionality
- [ ] Support issue creation from task specifications
- [ ] Implement issue status synchronization (open/closed/draft)
- [ ] Add support for GitHub issue labels for task categorization
- [ ] Handle issue assignments and milestone tracking

### CLI Integration

- [ ] Update `minsky tasks create` to support GitHub issues backend
- [ ] Update `minsky tasks list` to fetch from GitHub issues
- [ ] Update `minsky tasks status set` to modify issue state
- [ ] Add GitHub authentication handling

### Configuration

- [ ] Add GitHub repository configuration options
- [ ] Implement GitHub token management
- [ ] Support for repository selection and validation

### Error Handling

- [ ] Handle GitHub API rate limiting
- [ ] Manage network connectivity issues
- [ ] Provide clear error messages for authentication failures

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can create tasks that automatically create corresponding GitHub issues
2. Task status changes are reflected in GitHub issue state
3. GitHub issues can be listed and filtered using existing Minsky commands
4. Proper error handling for GitHub API failures
5. Authentication is handled securely
6. Integration works with both public and private repositories

## Dependencies

- GitHub API client library
- Authentication token management
- Existing task backend interface

## Estimated Effort

Large (8-12 hours)

## Notes

- Should integrate with existing task backend architecture
- Consider GitHub webhooks for real-time synchronization
- May need to handle GitHub-specific features like issue templates
- Should maintain compatibility with existing markdown backend
