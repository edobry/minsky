# Task #138: Add GitHub Issues Support as Task Backend

## Status

TODO

## Priority

Medium

## Summary

Implement GitHub Issues integration as a task backend option, allowing tasks to be managed directly within GitHub repositories as issues.

## Description

Currently, Minsky supports markdown and basic GitHub backend for task management. This task involves implementing full GitHub Issues support as a task backend, enabling users to:

1. Create tasks as GitHub issues
2. Update task status by modifying issue state and labels
3. List and filter tasks from GitHub issues
4. Sync task metadata between Minsky and GitHub issues
5. Support issue assignments, labels, and milestones

## Requirements

### Core Features

- [ ] Implement GitHub Issues API integration
- [ ] Create task-to-issue mapping functionality
- [ ] Support issue creation from task specifications
- [ ] Implement issue status synchronization (open/closed/draft)
- [ ] Add support for GitHub issue labels for task categorization
- [ ] Handle issue assignments and milestone tracking

### CLI Integration

- [ ] Update `minsky tasks create` to support GitHub issues backend
- [ ] Update `minsky tasks list` to fetch from GitHub issues
- [ ] Update `minsky tasks status set` to modify issue state
- [ ] Add GitHub authentication handling

### Configuration

- [ ] Add GitHub repository configuration options
- [ ] Implement GitHub token management
- [ ] Support for repository selection and validation

### Error Handling

- [ ] Handle GitHub API rate limiting
- [ ] Manage network connectivity issues
- [ ] Provide clear error messages for authentication failures

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can create tasks that automatically create corresponding GitHub issues
2. Task status changes are reflected in GitHub issue state
3. GitHub issues can be listed and filtered using existing Minsky commands
4. Proper error handling for GitHub API failures
5. Authentication is handled securely
6. Integration works with both public and private repositories

## Dependencies

- GitHub API client library
- Authentication token management
- Existing task backend interface

## Estimated Effort

Large (8-12 hours)

## Notes

- Should integrate with existing task backend architecture
- Consider GitHub webhooks for real-time synchronization
- May need to handle GitHub-specific features like issue templates
- Should maintain compatibility with existing markdown backend
