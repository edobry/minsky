# Investigate and Evaluate Configuration System Architecture

## Status

BACKLOG

## Priority

MEDIUM

## Description

## Problem Statement

The current configuration system may be overly complex or reinventing solutions that already exist in established libraries. We need to evaluate our current approach and compare it against industry-standard configuration libraries.

## Investigation Goals

### 1. Audit Current Configuration System

Document all features and design goals of our current configuration system:
- Configuration loading mechanisms
- Environment variable handling  
- Configuration validation and schema support
- Default value management
- Configuration merging/override capabilities
- File format support (JSON, YAML, etc.)
- Runtime configuration updates
- Configuration documentation/help generation
- Error handling and validation messages

### 2. Identify Design Requirements

Clarify what we actually need from a configuration system:
- Must-have features vs nice-to-have
- Performance requirements
- Integration requirements with existing codebase
- CLI-specific configuration needs
- Session and workspace-specific configuration
- Multi-environment support requirements

### 3. Library Research

Research and evaluate popular configuration libraries:
- Node.js configuration libraries (cosmiconfig, conf, rc, yargs, commander.js config features)
- TypeScript-first configuration libraries
- CLI-focused configuration solutions
- Libraries with strong validation support (joi, zod integration)

### 4. Gap Analysis

Compare current implementation against:
- Popular libraries' feature sets
- Implementation complexity
- Maintenance burden
- Community support and ecosystem
- Performance characteristics
- Bundle size impact

## Expected Outcomes

- Detailed documentation of current configuration system
- Recommendation: keep current system vs migrate to established library
- If migration recommended: specific library recommendation with migration plan
- If keeping current: list of improvements/simplifications to make

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete audit of current configuration system features
- [ ] Clear documentation of actual requirements vs implemented features  
- [ ] Evaluation of at least 3-5 established configuration libraries
- [ ] Concrete recommendation with justification
- [ ] If migration recommended: high-level migration plan with effort estimate
