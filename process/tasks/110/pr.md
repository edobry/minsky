# feat(#110): Create a Complete Test Inventory and Classification System

## Summary

This PR implements a test analyzer script that creates a comprehensive inventory and classification system for test files in the codebase. The system analyzes test files to identify patterns, categorize tests by mocking complexity and framework dependencies, and provide recommendations for migrating tests to work with Bun's test runner.

## Changes

### Added

- **Test Analyzer Script**: Created `src/scripts/test-analyzer.ts` to scan and analyze test files
- **Classification System**: Implemented a system that categorizes tests by:
  - Mocking complexity (low, medium, high)
  - Framework dependencies (Jest, Vitest, Bun)
  - Migration difficulty (easy, medium, hard)
  - Test type (unit, integration)
- **Pattern Detection**: Added pattern matching for common test patterns:
  - Mocking techniques (mock functions, spies, module mocks)
  - Test lifecycle hooks (beforeEach, afterEach)
  - Assertion styles
- **Report Generation**: Implemented JSON and Markdown report generation with:
  - Summary statistics
  - Detailed classification of each test file
  - Lists of files categorized by migration difficulty
  - Recommendations for migration strategy
- **Migration Strategy**: Provided a clear approach for test migration:
  - Prioritized list of "easy" tests to migrate first
  - Identification of common patterns causing failures
  - Recommendations for tackling complex tests

## Testing

The script was tested by running it against the entire src directory, which successfully analyzed 46 test files and generated detailed reports. The reports correctly identify:

- Files categorized by mocking complexity and migration difficulty
- Framework-specific dependencies that cause issues with Bun's test runner
- Priority files for migration based on complexity and test type
