# Task #085: Migrate CLI adapter tests to test domain methods instead

## Context

The CLI/MCP integration tests need to be migrated to test domain methods directly instead of testing through CLI/MCP interfaces. This aligns with our testing boundaries rule which emphasizes testing domain logic rather than interfaces.

The CLI adapter test files in `src/adapters/cli/__tests__` (`rules.test.ts`, `session.test.ts`) were previously deleted due to persistent syntax errors and outdated code. These tests were blocking the test suite and did not provide meaningful coverage in their current state.

There's also a specific TODO comment in `src/adapters/__tests__/integration/session.test.ts` noting that these tests should be replaced with tests that directly test domain methods instead of testing through CLI/MCP interfaces.

## Task

- Migrate CLI/MCP integration tests to use domain methods directly:
  - âœ… Replace placeholder test in `src/adapters/__tests__/integration/session.test.ts` with proper tests
  - âœ… Create new test file for rules with proper test structure
  - âœ… Ensure tests follow the testing-boundaries rule principles
  - âœ… Remove syntax errors and outdated patterns
  - ðŸ”„ Restore meaningful test coverage for CLI adapters (partial)
  - âœ… Prefer domain-level tests where possible, following project test rules
  - âœ… Ensure all new or migrated tests pass in both the main and session workspaces
  - âœ… Reference SpecStory history for context on why these files were removed

## Progress

### Completed
- Replaced placeholder test in `src/adapters/__tests__/integration/session.test.ts`
- Created proper tests for session operations (getSessionFromParams, listSessionsFromParams, deleteSessionFromParams, startSessionFromParams)
- Created new test file for rules domain methods
- Added tests for rules operations (listRules, getRule, searchRules, createRule)
- Implemented proper mocking with centralized test utilities
- Ensured tests follow testing-boundaries rule principles
- All implemented tests are passing

### Remaining Work
- Add tests for missing session domain methods:
  - âœ… updateSessionFromParams
  - âœ… getSessionDirFromParams
- Add tests for missing rules domain methods:
  - updateRule
- Consider adding tests for other domain modules:
  - Tasks domain methods (getTask, listTasks, updateTaskStatus)
  - Git domain methods (clone, checkout, getBranch)
  - Workspace domain methods (isSessionRepository, getCurrentSession)

## Requirements

1. âœ… Remove any remaining placeholder tests like `expect(true).toBe(true)`
2. âœ… Implement tests that validate domain logic rather than CLI output formatting
3. âœ… Use mocks for external dependencies (file system, git commands, etc.)
4. âœ… Follow the centralized test utilities pattern
5. âœ… Ensure tests run reliably and don't depend on specific environment state

## Acceptance Criteria

- âœ… New or migrated tests exist for CLI adapter logic (partial - some domain methods still need coverage)
- âœ… Tests follow the testing-boundaries rule (testing domain logic, not interfaces)
- âœ… No syntax errors or placeholder code remain
- âœ… All tests pass in both main and session workspaces
- âœ… Task is documented in the changelog and SpecStory history
