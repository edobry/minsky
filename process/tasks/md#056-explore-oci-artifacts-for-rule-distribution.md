# Explore OCI Artifacts for Rule Distribution

## Context

The Rule Library System currently relies on Git repositories for storage and distribution. As the system matures, we should investigate OCI (Open Container Initiative) Artifacts as a potential distribution mechanism that could provide benefits in versioning, compatibility, and security. OCI Artifacts offer a standardized, language-agnostic approach to artifact storage that is gaining adoption in the cloud-native ecosystem.

## Requirements

1. **Research OCI Artifacts Framework**

   - Investigate the OCI Artifacts specification and implementation
   - Study how other projects utilize OCI for non-container artifacts
   - Compare OCI Artifacts with Git-based distribution for rules
   - Determine advantages and challenges for Minsky's use case

2. **Prototype Implementation**

   - Create a proof of concept for storing Minsky rules in OCI registries
   - Implement basic functionality to push/pull rules to/from an OCI registry
   - Test with various registry implementations (GitHub Packages, Docker Hub, etc.)
   - Measure performance and resource requirements

3. **Integration Design**

   - Design how Minsky commands would interact with OCI registries
   - Determine authentication and security requirements
   - Plan a potential migration path from Git-based to OCI-based distribution
   - Consider hybrid approaches that leverage both Git and OCI

4. **Dynamic Rule Generation**

   - Research methods for dynamic rule content generation at install time
   - Prototype system for including CLI help output and other dynamic content
   - Explore mechanisms to extract and utilize sections from the Cursor agent prompt
   - Design an approach that provides both static and dynamic rule components

5. **Documentation**
   - Document findings and recommendations
   - Create integration roadmap if OCI is deemed beneficial
   - Update rule authoring guidelines to account for dynamic content

## Implementation Steps

1. [ ] Research Phase:

   - [ ] Study the OCI Distribution and Artifacts specifications
   - [ ] Analyze existing tools that leverage OCI (Helm, ORAS, etc.)
   - [ ] Document OCI registry types and compatibility requirements
   - [ ] Compare security models between Git and OCI approaches

2. [ ] Prototype Development:

   - [ ] Select an OCI client library compatible with Minsky's stack
   - [ ] Implement basic rule packaging for OCI storage
   - [ ] Create commands for pushing rules to OCI registries
   - [ ] Develop commands for pulling rules from OCI registries

3. [ ] Dynamic Content Generation:

   - [ ] Design a templating system for rules with dynamic content
   - [ ] Implement CLI output capture for inclusion in rules
   - [ ] Create a mechanism for rule compilation at installation time
   - [ ] Develop a system for extracting and transforming Cursor prompt sections

4. [ ] Integration Planning:

   - [ ] Update `minsky rules` commands to support OCI registries
   - [ ] Design changes needed for `minsky init` to work with OCI
   - [ ] Create authentication management for private registries
   - [ ] Define version compatibility validation for OCI artifacts

5. [ ] Testing and Documentation:
   - [ ] Test performance across different registry types
   - [ ] Document findings and implementation recommendations
   - [ ] Create migration guide for transitioning from Git to OCI
   - [ ] Update rule authoring documentation

## Verification

- [ ] OCI-based rules can be successfully published to multiple registry types
- [ ] Rules can be retrieved and installed from OCI registries
- [ ] Dynamic content generation works correctly at install time
- [ ] Performance is comparable or better than Git-based distribution
- [ ] Security and authentication mechanisms are robust
- [ ] Documentation clearly explains OCI usage and benefits

## Relation to Existing Components

- This task builds on the Rule Library System established in task #048
- It extends the `minsky rules` commands with OCI capabilities
- The dynamic content generation would enhance both Git and OCI-based approaches
- This would provide a foundation for migrating from Cursor-specific to platform-agnostic rule formats
