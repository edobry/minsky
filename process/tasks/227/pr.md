# feat(#227): Extend conflict detection to comprehensive git workflow protection

## Summary

This PR extends the ConflictDetectionService to provide comprehensive conflict prevention across all git operations in the Minsky workflow, not just session PR creation. It builds on the foundation from Task #221 to create a complete git workflow protection system.

## Changes

### Added

- **Branch switching warnings**:
  - Detection of uncommitted changes that would conflict with target branch
  - Warnings before checkout when switching would cause conflicts
  - Suggested stash/commit strategies before branch operations

- **Rebase conflict prediction**:
  - Simulation of rebase operations to detect conflicts before execution
  - Identification of problematic commits in rebase sequence
  - Complexity analysis and resolution time estimates
  - Tailored recommendations based on conflict complexity

- **Advanced auto-resolution strategies**:
  - Intelligent handling for package.json and lock files
  - Auto-resolution for formatting-only conflicts
  - Smart handling of documentation and config file conflicts
  - Pattern-based resolution strategies for common conflict types

### Changed

- Enhanced the ConflictDetectionService with new interfaces and methods
- Improved error handling and user guidance for conflict scenarios
- Updated task specification to track implementation progress

### Fixed

- Ensured proper cleanup of temporary branches after simulation operations
- Handled edge cases in conflict detection for various file types

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with various git operations including:
- Branch switching with uncommitted changes
- Rebase operations with conflicting commits
- Merge operations with different conflict types
- Advanced resolution strategies for common file patterns

## Checklist

- [x] All requirements implemented
- [x] Code quality is acceptable
- [x] Documentation is updated
- [x] Task status updated to IN-REVIEW
