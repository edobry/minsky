# Testable Design Pattern Expansion

## Context

## Overview

**MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Expand the pure business logic extraction approach that achieved 100% test success rate by creating more focused unit test modules.

## Problem Statement

Current codebase has opportunities to extract pure business logic for more focused, reliable unit testing:

- **Complex functions** mixing business logic with I/O operations
- **Large test files** testing multiple concerns simultaneously
- **Opportunities** to create pure, testable business logic modules
- **Pattern** proven successful in session update logic extraction

## Successful Reference Implementation

The session update logic extraction that contributed to 100% test success:

- **Extracted**: Pure conditional logic into focused functions
- **Created**: 21 new focused unit tests
- **Result**: Reliable, fast unit tests with no I/O dependencies
- **Pattern**: Separate pure business logic from side effects

## Target Areas for Extraction

### Priority 1: Session Operations

1. **Session Creation Logic**: Extract business rules from I/O operations
2. **Session Update Logic**: Expand on existing successful pattern
3. **Session Validation**: Pure validation functions
4. **Session State Management**: Pure state transition logic

### Priority 2: Task Management

1. **Task Status Transitions**: Pure business logic for status changes
2. **Task Validation**: Extract validation rules from persistence layer
3. **Task ID Generation**: Pure ID generation and validation logic
4. **Task Filtering**: Pure filtering and sorting logic

### Priority 3: Configuration Management

1. **Configuration Validation**: Pure validation without file I/O
2. **Configuration Merging**: Pure merge logic
3. **Environment Detection**: Extract from system calls

## Success Criteria

- [ ] 3+ new pure business logic modules created
- [ ] 50+ new focused unit tests added
- [ ] No I/O operations in pure business logic functions
- [ ] All pure functions have 100% unit test coverage
- [ ] Integration tests cover I/O wrapper functions
- [ ] Test execution time improved (pure functions are faster)
- [ ] Pattern documented for future development

## Notes

- This builds directly on the proven session update extraction success
- Focus on business logic extraction rather than infrastructure changes
- Pattern here should become standard for all new development
