# Task #061: Implement Test Fixture Factory Pattern

## Context
Manual creation of test data and mock objects is repetitive and error-prone. Introducing a fixture factory pattern will standardize test data creation, improve consistency, and make tests easier to write and maintain.

## Requirements
- Create a new module (e.g., `test-utils/fixtures.ts`) for test data fixture factories.
- Implement factory functions for common data structures and mock objects used in tests (e.g., Task, Session, GitService mocks).
- Ensure factories allow overriding default values for specific test cases.
- Update existing tests to use these new fixture factories where appropriate.

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Create `src/utils/test-utils/fixtures.ts`
- [ ] Implement `createMockTask` fixture factory
- [ ] Implement `createMockSession` fixture factory
- [ ] Implement fixture factories for common mock objects (e.g., `createMockGitService`)
- [ ] Export factories from `src/utils/test-utils/index.ts`
- [ ] Refactor relevant test files (`src/domain/__tests__/*.test.ts`, `src/adapters/__tests__/integration/*.test.ts`) to use new factories.
- [ ] Update documentation.

## Verification
- [ ] All tests pass after refactoring.
- [ ] New tests correctly use the fixture factories.
- [ ] The codebase shows reduced duplication in test data creation.
