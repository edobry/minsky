# Complete Test Fixture Factory Pattern Implementation

## Context

Manual creation of test data and mock objects is repetitive and error-prone. The fixture factory pattern has been **partially implemented** with data factories, but service mock factories are still duplicated across test files. This task completes the remaining work to fully standardize test utilities.

## Current State âœ…

**Already Implemented:**
- âœ… Data factories exist in `src/utils/test-utils/factories.ts`:
  - `createTaskData()` - Creates test task data with overrides
  - `createSessionData()` - Creates test session data
  - `createRepositoryData()` - Creates test repository data
  - `createTaskDataArray()` & `createSessionDataArray()` - Create arrays of test data
- âœ… Enhanced test utilities in `src/utils/test-utils/dependencies.ts`
- âœ… Factories exported from `src/utils/test-utils/index.ts`
- âœ… Test files actively using these factories

## Remaining Work ðŸ”²

**Service Mock Duplication Problem:**
Analysis shows 15+ instances of duplicated mock creation patterns:
- `createMockSessionProvider` duplicated in 5+ test files
- `createMockGitService` duplicated in 8+ test files
- `createMockTaskService` duplicated in 4+ test files

## Requirements

1. **Add Centralized Service Mock Factories** to `src/utils/test-utils/dependencies.ts`:
   - `createMockSessionProvider()` with comprehensive interface coverage
   - `createMockGitService()` with all required methods
   - `createMockTaskService()` with standard implementations
   - Each factory should allow overrides for specific test cases

2. **Export New Factories** from `src/utils/test-utils/index.ts`

3. **Demonstrate Usage** with comprehensive test coverage

## Implementation Steps

- [ ] **Add `createMockSessionProvider`** factory to `dependencies.ts`
  - Include all `SessionProviderInterface` methods
  - Provide sensible defaults for common operations
  - Allow method overrides via options parameter

- [ ] **Add `createMockGitService`** factory to `dependencies.ts`
  - Include all `GitServiceInterface` methods
  - Provide realistic mock responses
  - Support command-specific overrides

- [ ] **Add `createMockTaskService`** factory to `dependencies.ts`
  - Include all `TaskServiceInterface` methods
  - Provide consistent task data responses
  - Support task state management

- [ ] **Export new factories** from `index.ts`

- [ ] **Add comprehensive tests** for the new factories

- [ ] **Update documentation** with usage examples

## Verification

- [ ] All new factories are properly exported and accessible
- [ ] Each factory provides comprehensive interface coverage
- [ ] Factories support override patterns for test customization
- [ ] Test suite demonstrates proper usage patterns
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors

## Success Criteria

- Service mock factories eliminate 200+ lines of duplicated code
- Test files can import and use centralized mocks instead of creating their own
- Interface changes require updates in only one location
- Developers can quickly create comprehensive mocks for testing

## Future Work (Separate Task)

- Refactor existing test files to use centralized factories
- Create automated migration tool for mock patterns
- Add factories for other commonly mocked interfaces
