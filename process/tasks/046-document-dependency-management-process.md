# Task #046: Document Dependency Management Process

## Context

Task #030 (Setup Project Tooling and Automation) included setting up dependency management tooling, including Dependabot for automated updates. However, the documentation of the dependency management process was not completed. This task addresses the need for clear documentation on how dependencies are managed in the Minsky project.

## Requirements

1. **Dependency Management Documentation**
   - Document the Dependabot configuration and how it works
   - Document the process for reviewing and approving dependency updates
   - Document the package.json organization and standards
   - Explain the use of Bun for dependency management rather than npm

2. **Dependency Audit Process**
   - Document the security audit process
   - Explain how to interpret and address audit findings
   - Document policies for addressing vulnerabilities

3. **Developer Guidelines**
   - Create guidelines for adding new dependencies
   - Document criteria for selecting dependencies
   - Document version pinning strategy
   - Explain the peer dependencies approach

4. **Integration with Workflow**
   - Document how dependency updates integrate with the PR process
   - Explain CI/CD checks for dependencies
   - Document the release process and dependency impact

## Implementation Steps

   - [ ] Explain version pinning strategy
   - [ ] Document peer dependencies approach

4. [ ] Document workflow integration
   - [ ] Explain dependency updates in PR process
   - [ ] Document CI/CD checks for dependencies
   - [ ] Explain dependency impact on releases

5. [ ] Create examples and templates
