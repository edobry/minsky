# Task #104: Disabled Tests Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the disabled integration tests that need to be re-implemented. We'll examine the issues that caused the tests to be disabled and develop a strategy for re-implementing them using the improved testing patterns established in tasks #101-#103.

## Disabled Test Files

1. `src/adapters/__tests__/integration/workspace.test.ts`
2. `src/adapters/__tests__/integration/git.test.ts`
3. `src/domain/__tests__/github-backend.test.ts`
4. `src/domain/__tests__/github-basic.test.ts`
5. `src/adapters/__tests__/cli/session.test.ts`
6. `src/adapters/__tests__/cli/tasks.test.ts`

## Initial Analysis

### Common Issues in Disabled Tests

1. **Dependency Management Issues**
   - Direct module imports making mocking difficult
   - Use of readonly properties causing TypeScript errors when attempting to mock
   - Lack of consistent dependency injection pattern

2. **Side Effects and State Management**
   - Tests affecting global state
   - Lack of proper test isolation
   - Dependencies on filesystem and environment

3. **Test Framework Compatibility**
   - Jest-style mocking not fully compatible with Bun test environment
   - Limitations in Bun's test mocking capabilities

### Specific Issues by Test File

#### `workspace.test.ts` Issues
- Needs mocking for:
  - `isSessionRepository`
  - `getSessionFromRepo`
  - `getCurrentSession`
  - `resolveWorkspacePath`
- Filesystem operation mocking was problematic

#### `git.test.ts` Issues
- Git command execution mocking challenges
- File system operation mocking needed
- Test isolation problems

#### GitHub Backend Test Issues
- Complex mocking requirements for:
  - `fs/promises`
  - `child_process.exec`
  - `SessionDB`
  - `GitService`

#### CLI Adapter Test Issues
- Command execution simulation challenges
- User input mocking difficulties
- Output verification approach

## Improvements from Tasks #101-#103

### Task #101: Improved Dependency Injection
- Created interfaces for all domain services
- Refactored domain functions to accept dependencies as parameters
- Created `createTestDeps` utility for test dependencies

### Task #102 (and subtasks #106-#108): Functional Patterns
- Refactored stateful classes to functional approach
- Extracted side effects to the edges
- Improved error handling with pure functions

### Task #103: Enhanced Test Utilities
- Added mock creation utilities with better type safety
- Created test context management utilities
- Implemented test data generation utilities

## Next Steps

1. Review git history to find original test implementations
2. Compare with new testing patterns from tasks #101-#103
3. Create test implementation plan for each disabled test file
4. Begin re-implementation with workspace integration tests first
