# Enhance Test Utilities for Better Domain Testing

## Context

The current test utilities in the project are limited, which leads to duplication of test setup code and complex mocking patterns. We need more robust utilities that support the dependency injection patterns and interface-based testing approach we're implementing in the other tasks.

## Requirements

1. **Dependency Generation Utilities**

   - Create utilities for generating complete test dependency objects
   - Support partial implementations with sensible defaults
   - Integrate with TypeScript type system for type safety

2. **Mock Creation Enhancements**

   - Improve the existing `createMock` utility to better handle type constraints
   - Add support for complex mock scenarios without type casting
   - Create pattern for mocking readonly properties safely

3. **Test Data Generation**

   - Create fixtures for common domain objects (Sessions, Tasks, etc.)
   - Add randomized test data generation utilities
   - Implement factory patterns for consistent test data

4. **Test Setup/Teardown**
   - Create standardized patterns for test setup and teardown
   - Implement test context management utilities
   - Provide isolation between tests to prevent leakage

## Implementation Steps

1. [ ] Enhance mock creation utilities:

   - [ ] Create `createPartialMock` for partial implementations
   - [ ] Add type-safe `mockFunction` utility
   - [ ] Create `createTestSuite` utility for managing test context

2. [ ] Add dependency generation utilities:

   - [ ] Create `createTestDeps` for generating dependency objects
   - [ ] Implement `withMockedDeps` for overriding defaults
   - [ ] Add utilities for complex dependency chains

3. [ ] Implement test data generation:

   - [ ] Create factory functions for domain entities
   - [ ] Add randomization utilities for property values
   - [ ] Implement fixtures for common test scenarios

4. [ ] Document and standardize usage patterns:
   - [ ] Create examples for each utility
   - [ ] Add documentation for best practices
   - [ ] Update existing tests to use new patterns

## Verification

- [ ] All new utilities have corresponding test cases
- [ ] Test code duplication is reduced across the codebase
- [ ] Type safety is maintained without `as any` casting
- [ ] Existing tests can be refactored to use the new utilities
