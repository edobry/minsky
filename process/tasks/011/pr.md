## Summary of Changes

This PR implements the fixes and improvements to the `git pr` command as defined in Task #011. Key changes include:

1. **Test Refactoring:**
   - Replaced real git operations with proper mocks using Bun's test mocking capabilities
   - Implemented dependency injection for better testability in the GitService
   - Fixed timeout issues and improved error handling in domain tests

2. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:**
   - Added tests for base branch detection logic (remote HEAD, upstream, main/master, first commit)
   - Added tests for edge cases (no modified files, uncommitted changes, untracked files)
   - Improved validation of PR description output

3. **Command Logic Improvements:**
   - Fixed the PR command to properly handle process.exit
   - Improved error handling and reporting
   - Enhanced session directory path handling and file:// URL support

4. **General Improvements:**
   - Improved TypeScript types throughout the codebase
   - Added proper cleanup in tests with try/finally blocks
   - Enhanced debug logging with the --debug flag
   - Ensured all tests are properly isolated and don't rely on local git state

All acceptance criteria have been met and all tests are passing.
