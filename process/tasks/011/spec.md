# Task 011: Fix `git pr` Command and Add Proper Tests

## Problem Statement
The current `git pr` command implementation has issues with its test suite. The tests are using real git commands instead of proper mocking, which makes them unreliable and potentially affected by the local environment. Additionally, the command's behavior regarding merge base detection and commit history needs to be properly tested.

## Objectives
1. Refactor the `git pr` command tests to use proper mocking
2. Ensure the command correctly identifies the merge base
3. Verify that only commits since the merge base are included in the PR description
4. Add comprehensive test coverage for different scenarios
5. Fix any issues discovered during testing

## Implementation Details

### Test Refactoring
1. Replace real git operations with proper mocks using Bun's test mocking capabilities
2. Mock all git commands used by the PR generation:
   - `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
   - `git remote show origin`
   - `git merge-base`
   - `git diff --name-status`
   - `git diff --shortstat`
   - `git log`

### Test Scenarios
1. Basic PR generation
   - Current branch with merge base
   - Modified files list
   - Commit history since merge base
   
2. Base branch detection
   - Remote HEAD branch
   - Upstream tracking branch
   - Local main/master branch
   - First commit fallback
   
3. Edge cases
   - No modified files
   - Single commit
   - No merge base found
   - Working directory changes

### Command Behavior Verification
1. Verify merge base detection logic
2. Ensure only relevant commits are included
3. Validate file change statistics
4. Check working directory changes handling

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All tests pass using proper mocking
2. Test coverage includes all major scenarios
3. PR description only includes commits since merge base
4. File changes accurately reflect the diff from merge base
5. Command handles edge cases gracefully

## Notes
- Use Bun's test mocking capabilities instead of real git operations
- Ensure tests are deterministic and not affected by local git state
- Document any discovered issues or improvements needed in the command itself 

## Work Log
- 2024-07-11: Set up test files for git pr command and domain module
- 2024-07-11: Refactored PR command tests to avoid process.exit issues by creating a helper function that returns success/error status
- 2024-07-11: Simplified domain tests to focus on basic error case
- 2024-07-11: Fixed issue with mock implementations and error handling in tests

## Remaining Work
- Add more comprehensive tests for domain logic
- Fix test timeouts in domain tests
- Implement the rest of the test scenarios described in the implementation details
- Verify all acceptance criteria are met
