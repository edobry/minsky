# Task #234: Implement Dagger CI Pipeline with Hybrid Development Workflow

## Status

TODO

## Priority

HIGH

## Description

Implement a Dagger-based CI pipeline using the hybrid approach pattern from the community research. This will provide local development speed with CI consistency and cross-platform portability.

## Objectives

### 1. **Dagger Module Setup**

- Initialize Dagger module in the project root
- Create core CI functions: `test`, `lint`, `build`, `security-scan`
- Integrate with existing justfile build system
- Set up proper caching and environment configuration

### 2. **Hybrid Development Workflow**

- **Local Development**: Keep existing justfile for fast iteration
- **CI Pipeline**: Use Dagger for consistency and portability
- Ensure both paths produce identical results
- Document when to use each approach

### 3. **Core Dagger Functions**

- `Test()`: Run bun test suite with proper environment
- `Lint()`: Execute linting with ESLint/TypeScript checks
- `Build()`: Build binaries using existing justfile logic
- `SecurityScan()`: Implement security scanning
- `CI()`: Orchestrate full pipeline with proper error handling

### 4. **Observability Integration**

- Configure OpenTelemetry resource attributes
- Set up Dagger Cloud integration for trace visualization
- Implement structured logging for better CI integration
- Add performance telemetry for build optimization

### 5. **CI Platform Integration**

- Create minimal GitHub Actions workflow using split function approach
- Ensure individual step visibility in CI UI
- Configure proper artifact handling and caching
- Set up failure notifications and reporting

### 6. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**

- Test Dagger functions on multiple platforms
- Ensure consistent behavior across local/CI environments
- Document platform-specific considerations
- Validate binary builds work correctly

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Dagger Module

```bash
# Initialize Dagger module
dagger init

# Create main CI module structure
dagger develop --sdk=go # or typescript based on preference
```

### Phase 2: Function Implementation

- Start with `Test()` function integrating with existing bun test
- Add `Lint()` function for code quality checks
- Implement `Build()` function calling existing justfile recipes
- Create `SecurityScan()` for vulnerability scanning

### Phase 3: CI Integration

- Replace existing GitHub Actions with Dagger-based workflow
- Implement split function approach for visibility
- Configure artifact upload and release integration
- Set up proper environment variable and secret handling

### Phase 4: Observability Setup

- Configure Dagger Cloud account and integration
- Set up OpenTelemetry tracing
- Implement performance monitoring
- Add structured logging for debugging

## Technical Requirements

### Dagger Module Structure

```
/dagger/
├── dagger.json
├── main.go (or main.ts)
├── ci.go
├── build.go
├── test.go
└── security.go
```

### Required Functions

- `Test(source *Directory) (string, error)` - Run test suite
- `Lint(source *Directory) (string, error)` - Code quality checks
- `Build(source *Directory) (*Directory, error)` - Build binaries
- `SecurityScan(source *Directory) (string, error)` - Security scanning
- `CI(source *Directory) (string, error)` - Full pipeline orchestration

### GitHub Actions Integration

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install Dagger
        run: curl -fsSL https://dl.dagger.io/dagger/install.sh | sh
      - name: Run Tests
        run: dagger call test --source=.

  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install Dagger
        run: curl -fsSL https://dl.dagger.io/dagger/install.sh | sh
      - name: Run Linting
        run: dagger call lint --source=.

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install Dagger
        run: curl -fsSL https://dl.dagger.io/dagger/install.sh | sh
      - name: Build Binaries
        run: dagger call build --source=.
```

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] All existing CI functionality replicated in Dagger
- [ ] Local development workflow unchanged (justfile still works)
- [ ] CI pipeline runs successfully on GitHub Actions
- [ ] Binary builds produce identical artifacts
- [ ] Test suite runs with same coverage and results

### Performance Requirements

- [ ] CI pipeline completes within existing time constraints
- [ ] Proper caching reduces redundant work
- [ ] Local Dagger execution is reasonably fast
- [ ] Memory and CPU usage is optimized

### Observability Requirements

- [ ] Dagger Cloud traces show detailed execution flow
- [ ] Individual CI steps visible in GitHub Actions UI
- [ ] Error reporting provides clear debugging information
- [ ] Performance metrics available for optimization

### Documentation Requirements

- [ ] Clear documentation for when to use justfile vs Dagger
- [ ] CI pipeline troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Dagger Cloud setup and usage instructions
- [ ] Migration guide from pure GitHub Actions

## Implementation Notes

### Integration with Existing Systems

- Preserve existing justfile recipes for local development
- Ensure Dagger functions call justfile where appropriate
- Maintain compatibility with existing build artifacts
- Keep semantic-release integration functional

### Platform Considerations

- Test on macOS (primary development platform)
- Validate Linux compatibility for CI
- Ensure Windows builds work correctly
- Test cross-compilation scenarios

### Security Considerations

- Properly handle secrets and environment variables
- Implement security scanning in CI pipeline
- Ensure container security best practices
- Validate supply chain security

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed and running
- Dagger CLI installed
- Access to GitHub Actions
- Dagger Cloud account (free tier)

### Related Tasks

- Task #164: Binary builds and GitHub Actions (completed)
- Task #233: Semantic-release setup (pending)
- Integration with existing build system

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Dagger module successfully initialized** with proper structure
2. **All CI functions implemented** and tested locally
3. **GitHub Actions workflow updated** with split function approach
4. **Observability configured** with Dagger Cloud traces
5. **Documentation completed** for hybrid workflow
6. **Performance validated** meets or exceeds current CI times
7. **Cross-platform compatibility** verified
8. **Security scanning** integrated and functional

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Container overhead**: Mitigated by hybrid approach and caching
