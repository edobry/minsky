## Priority: Medium

## Description

Explore consolidating our custom ESLint rules (specifically the `no-underscore-prefix-mismatch` rule with autofix capability) with our existing codemod infrastructure. There appears to be significant conceptual overlap between ESLint autofixes and standalone codemods, and this could lead to better maintainability and unified approach to automated code fixes.

## Background

Currently we have two parallel approaches for automated code fixes:

1. **Custom ESLint Rules** (`src/eslint-rules/no-underscore-prefix-mismatch.js`):

   - Detects variable declaration/usage mismatches with underscore prefixes
   - Provides autofix capability through ESLint's fix API
   - Integrates with ESLint workflow and editor tooling
   - Runs during linting process

2. **Standalone Codemods** (`codemods/fix-variable-naming-ast.ts` and others):
   - Uses ts-morph for AST-based transformations
   - Handles similar variable naming issues
   - Runs as standalone scripts
   - More powerful for complex transformations

## Conceptual Overlap Analysis

### Similarities

- Both solve TypeScript/JavaScript code issues automatically
- Both handle variable naming issues (underscore prefix mismatches)
- Both provide fixes, not just detection
- Both are AST-based approaches (ESLint rule uses ESLint's AST, codemod uses ts-morph)
- Both follow the automation-approaches rule preference for AST-based solutions

### Differences

- **ESLint Rules**: Integrated into development workflow, runs on save/commit
- **Codemods**: One-time transformations, more powerful for bulk changes
- **ESLint Rules**: Limited to ESLint's AST and fix API
- **Codemods**: Full TypeScript compiler API access through ts-morph

## Investigation Areas

### 1. Analyze Current Redundancy

**Tasks:**

- Map all current ESLint rules with autofixes
- Identify corresponding codemods that solve similar issues
- Quantify the overlap in functionality
- Document maintenance burden of parallel approaches

**Files to examine:**

- `src/eslint-rules/no-underscore-prefix-mismatch.js`
- `src/eslint-rules/no-real-fs-in-tests.js` (already ESLint rule)
- `codemods/fix-variable-naming-ast.ts`
- `codemods/fix-test-filesystem-imports-ast.ts` (detection-only, ESLint candidate)
- `codemods/fix-*.ts` (all variable naming related codemods)
- `eslint.config.js` (current ESLint configuration)

### 2. Evaluate Consolidation Approaches

**Option A: ESLint-First Approach**

- Expand ESLint rules to cover more cases
- Use ESLint autofixes for development-time fixes
- Keep codemods for complex one-time transformations
- Pros: Integrated workflow, real-time feedback
- Cons: Limited by ESLint's AST API

**Option B: Codemod-First Approach**

- Convert ESLint rules to codemods
- Use codemods for all automated fixes
- Keep ESLint for detection-only rules
- Pros: Full TypeScript compiler API access
- Cons: Less integrated into development workflow

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**

- ESLint rules for real-time detection and simple fixes
- Codemods for complex transformations and bulk operations
- Shared logic between both approaches
- Clear decision matrix for when to use each

### 3. Technical Feasibility Analysis

**Shared Infrastructure:**

- Can we create shared AST utilities used by both approaches?
- How to avoid duplicating pattern recognition logic?
- Can we generate ESLint rules from codemod definitions?

**Workflow Integration:**

- How to integrate codemods into ESLint workflow?
- Can we run codemods from ESLint rules?
- How to maintain editor integration benefits?

### 4. Performance and Maintenance Impact

**Performance Considerations:**

- ESLint rules run on every file change
- Codemods run on-demand for bulk changes
- Impact on development workflow speed

**Maintenance Burden:**

- Current effort to maintain both approaches
- Potential reduction with consolidation
- Long-term scalability considerations

## Core Principle: Detection vs Transformation

**Key Insight**: The fundamental distinction is not complexity but **intent**:

- **Detection + Guidance = ESLint Rule** (even if using complex AST analysis)
- **Actual Code Transformation = Codemod** (even if simple find/replace)

**Detection Masquerading as Transformation** is an anti-pattern that creates:
- Redundant tooling
- Manual execution overhead
- Worse developer experience
- Maintenance burden

## Decision Framework

### When to Use ESLint Rules

- Simple, frequent fixes needed during development
- Real-time feedback required
- Integration with editor tooling important
- Pattern detection with simple AST manipulations
- **Detection-only scenarios that create manual todo items**
- **Guidance and education about architectural patterns**

### When to Use Codemods

- Complex AST transformations required
- Bulk operations on entire codebase
- One-time migration or refactoring tasks
- Need full TypeScript compiler API access
- **Actual code transformations, not just detection**
- **When automated fixes are safe and well-defined**

### Consolidation Opportunities

- Variable naming issues (current overlap)
- **Filesystem imports in tests (NEW: detection-only "codemod" should be ESLint rule)**
- Type annotation fixes
- Import/export statement cleanup
- Common pattern transformations

### Critical Discovery: Detection-Only Codemods Are ESLint Rules

**Recent Finding:** The `fix-test-filesystem-imports-ast.ts` codemod demonstrates a key anti-pattern:

- **Purpose**: Detect commented filesystem imports that cause infinite loops
- **Action**: Replace comments with dependency injection guidance
- **Result**: Creates todo items for manual refactoring

**Analysis**: This is **pure detection with guidance** - exactly what ESLint rules excel at! The existing `no-real-fs-in-tests.js` ESLint rule already catches 657+ instances of this pattern in real-time during development.

**Consolidation Recommendation**:
- ‚ùå **Remove** the detection-only codemod
- ‚úÖ **Enhance** the existing ESLint rule with better messaging
- ‚úÖ **Keep** codemods for actual transformations only

## Concrete Example Analysis: Filesystem Imports

### Current State (Inefficient Duplication)

**ESLint Rule (`no-real-fs-in-tests.js`):**
- ‚úÖ **Real-time detection** during development
- ‚úÖ **657+ violations caught** across codebase
- ‚úÖ **Integrated workflow** (runs on save/commit)
- ‚úÖ **Clear error messages** with guidance
- ‚úÖ **Editor integration** with squiggly underlines

**Codemod (`fix-test-filesystem-imports-ast.ts`):**
- ‚ùå **Detection-only** (doesn't actually transform code)
- ‚ùå **Manual execution** required
- ‚ùå **Creates todo items** that ESLint already identifies
- ‚ùå **Duplicates existing ESLint functionality**
- ‚ùå **Less discoverable** than real-time ESLint feedback

### Optimal Approach: ESLint-First

**Enhanced ESLint Rule:**
```javascript
// Better messaging in existing rule
"Real filesystem operation 'writeFile' is forbidden in tests.
Use dependency injection with mock implementations instead.
See: /docs/testing-patterns.md#dependency-injection"
```

**Result:**
- üéØ **Single source of truth** for detection
- üéØ **Real-time developer feedback**
- üéØ **Integrated workflow** without manual steps
- üéØ **Better developer experience** with immediate guidance

## Implementation Plan

5. Gather feedback on developer experience

### Phase 3: Decision and Roadmap
