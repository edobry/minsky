# Fix all linter errors in codebase

## Context

Fix 10 errors related to Jest patterns that should use Bun patterns and 40 warnings about excessive 'as unknown' assertions throughout the codebase.

**Primary Task**: This task consolidates all linter error fixes (merged from Task #318).

## Requirements

1. **Jest â†’ Bun Pattern Conversion**: Fix 10 errors related to Jest testing patterns that should use Bun testing patterns
2. **'as unknown' Assertion Cleanup**: Address 40 warnings about excessive 'as unknown' type assertions throughout the codebase
3. **General Linter Error Resolution**: Fix any other linter errors encountered during the codebase cleanup

## Solution

To be implemented:

- Identify and convert Jest-specific patterns to Bun equivalents
- Review and refactor 'as unknown' assertions to use proper typing
- Run comprehensive linter check and fix remaining issues

## Notes

- Task #318 was marked as duplicate and consolidated into this task
- This is now the primary tracking task for all linter error fixes
- Focus on systematic approach to address both specific error categories and general linter compliance
