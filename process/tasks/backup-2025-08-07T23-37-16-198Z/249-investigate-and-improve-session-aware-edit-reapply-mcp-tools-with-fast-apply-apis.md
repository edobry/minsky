# Investigate and Improve Session-Aware Edit/Reapply MCP Tools with Fast-Apply APIs

## Status

COMPLETED

## Priority

HIGH

## Description

**CRITICAL**: Phase 1 investigation revealed our current session-aware edit tools are completely non-functional:

1. **Complete Failure**: 0% success rate on all test scenarios (12/12 tests failed)
2. **Broken Pattern Matching**: `applyEditPattern` cannot match even basic content due to oversimplified `indexOf` approach
3. **No Reapply Functionality**: Missing the critical `reapply` tool for recovering from failed edits
4. **High Maintenance Burden**: Custom logic is fundamentally flawed and unreliable

## Context

**Phase 1 Findings**: Current implementation has 0% success rate - this is not an optimization but a functionality restoration. Fast-apply model providers offer the only viable solution:

- **Morph API**: 4,500+ tokens/sec, 98% accuracy, enterprise-ready
- **Relace API**: 2,000+ tokens/sec, 98% accuracy, Continue.dev integration
- **Business Impact**: Infinite ROI (from completely broken to working)
- **Market Validation**: Used in production by major companies

## Goals

1. **✅ COMPLETED - Current Implementation Analysis**: Confirmed complete failure (0% success rate)
2. **✅ COMPLETED - Fast-Apply API Research**: Validated Morph and Relace as viable solutions
3. **✅ COMPLETED - Morph Integration**: Implemented using existing AI provider infrastructure
4. **✅ COMPLETED - Model Capabilities Framework**: Extended AI provider types to support fast-apply capabilities
5. **✅ COMPLETED - Fast-Apply Testing Command**: Created `minsky ai fast-apply` command for testing
6. **✅ COMPLETED - Replace Broken Session Edit Tools**: Fixed session_edit_file and session_search_replace
7. **✅ COMPLETED - Morph API Specification Compliance**: Fixed implementation to match official Morph API format exactly
8. **DEFERRED - Reapply Functionality**: Moved to separate task for focused implementation
