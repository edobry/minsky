# Investigate session workspace disk usage and optimize node_modules storage

## Status

## Priority

MEDIUM

## Description

Each session workspace contains ~300MB including full node_modules directory. Investigate if we can optimize storage by sharing node_modules or using symlinks/hardlinks to reduce per-session storage overhead. Current analysis shows 2.1GB across 8 sessions mostly due to duplicated dependencies.
