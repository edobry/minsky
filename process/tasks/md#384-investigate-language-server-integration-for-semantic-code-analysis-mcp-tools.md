# Investigate Language Server Integration for Semantic Code Analysis MCP Tools

## Context

Research and design integration of language server capabilities to provide MCP tools with semantic code understanding, enabling operations like "find where this function is defined", "find where this interface is implemented", etc.

## Objective

Investigate integrating TypeScript/JavaScript language server capabilities into the MCP (Model Context Protocol) to provide agents with semantic code analysis tools that leverage formal language semantics rather than similarity-based search.

## Key Areas of Investigation

### 1. Language Server Protocol (LSP) Research

- Research existing LSP implementations (TypeScript Language Server, etc.)
- Understand LSP capabilities for semantic analysis:
  - Go to definition
  - Find references
  - Find implementations
  - Symbol search
  - Type information
  - Call hierarchy
  - Inheritance hierarchy

### 2. State-of-the-Art Analysis

- Research existing tools that provide semantic code analysis:
  - GitHub Copilot Workspace
  - Sourcegraph
  - Continue.dev
  - Aider
  - Other AI coding assistants
- Analyze how they integrate with language servers
- Identify best practices and proven patterns

### 3. MCP Integration Design

- Design MCP tools that would provide:
  - `find_definition`: Find where symbols are defined
  - `find_references`: Find all usages of symbols
  - `find_implementations`: Find interface/abstract class implementations
  - `get_type_info`: Get detailed type information
  - `get_call_hierarchy`: Analyze function call relationships
  - `get_symbol_info`: Get comprehensive symbol metadata
  - `semantic_search`: Search by semantic meaning rather than text

### 4. Technical Architecture

- Research integration approaches:
  - Direct LSP client integration
  - Language server as a service
  - Hybrid approaches combining LSP with existing tools
- Analyze performance implications
- Design caching and optimization strategies

### 5. Implementation Scope

- Determine which language servers to support initially (TypeScript/JavaScript priority)
- Define MCP tool interfaces and schemas
- Plan incremental implementation approach
- Consider workspace initialization and configuration

### 6. Comparison with Current Approach

- Analyze current similarity-search limitations
- Quantify potential improvements in accuracy and usefulness
- Define success metrics and evaluation criteria

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Research Report**: Comprehensive analysis of existing approaches and SOTA
2. **Technical Design**: Detailed architecture for LSP-MCP integration
3. **Implementation Plan**: Phased approach with clear milestones
4. **Prototype Specification**: Detailed specs for initial MCP tools
5. **Evaluation Framework**: Methods to measure improvement over current approach

## Success Criteria

- Clear understanding of technical feasibility and implementation complexity
- Concrete design for semantic analysis MCP tools
- Evidence-based recommendation on whether to proceed with implementation
- If proceeding, detailed roadmap with realistic timelines
