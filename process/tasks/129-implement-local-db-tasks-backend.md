# Task #129: Implement Local DB Tasks Backend

## Context

The current Minsky CLI uses a file-based approach (`tasks.md`) as its default task management backend, with a placeholder for a GitHub backend. This approach creates synchronization challenges when working across multiple sessions or workspaces. Specifically:

1. When a user edits the `tasks.md` file in a session, those changes are not reflected in other sessions or in the main workspace
2. This can lead to out-of-date task information when working in different contexts
3. Sometimes conflicting task IDs can occur due to this lack of synchronization

We need a more robust backend similar to the SessionDB, which already uses a local JSON file stored in a centralized location.

## Requirements

1. **Create a DatabaseStorage abstraction layer** that can support multiple storage backends (JSON file, SQLite, etc.)
2. **Implement JsonFileTaskBackend** using the abstraction to store tasks in a JSON file at `~/.local/state/minsky/tasks.json`
3. **Provide migration utilities** to convert existing `tasks.md` files to the new JSON format
4. **Maintain API compatibility** with the existing TaskBackend interface
5. **Support transparent upgrades** to other database backends (e.g., SQLite) in the future
6. **Ensure synchronization** across multiple sessions and workspaces

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Storage Abstraction Layer âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Create DatabaseStorage interface** (`src/domain/storage/database-storage.ts`)
  - Generic interface supporting any entity and state types
  - CRUD operations with proper error handling
  - Query capabilities and batch operations
- [x] **Implement JsonFileStorage** (`src/domain/storage/json-file-storage.ts`)
  - Concrete implementation for JSON file storage
  - Thread-safe operations with atomic writes
  - Configurable paths and initialization
- [x] **Create migration utilities** (`src/domain/tasks/migration-utils.ts`)
  - Bidirectional conversion between markdown and JSON
  - Backup creation and conflict resolution
  - Format comparison and synchronization detection

### Phase 2: TaskBackend Implementation ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
- [ ] **Create JsonFileTaskBackend** (`src/domain/tasks/jsonFileTaskBackend.ts`)
  - Implement TaskBackend interface using DatabaseStorage
  - Handle task CRUD operations via the JSON storage
  - Maintain compatibility with existing task operations
- [ ] **Fix linter errors** in migration utilities
  - Replace `log.info` with appropriate logger methods
  - Fix TypeScript type issues with regex matches
  - Resolve module import issues

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Fix remaining linter issues**
  - âœ… **OS module import**: Replaced with cross-platform home directory function using process.env
  - âœ… **Bun test API compatibility**: Fixed test imports, methods, and array access patterns
  - âœ… **Session workspace compatibility**: All imports and operations now work correctly in session context
- [x] **Update TaskService** to support JsonFileTaskBackend
  - âœ… Added JsonFileTaskBackend to default backends with "json-file" as new default backend
  - âœ… Maintained backward compatibility with markdown backend
  - âœ… Fixed parseTaskSpec to properly extract task IDs from specification files
- [x] **Create comprehensive tests**
  - âœ… Basic JsonFileTaskBackend test suite (12 tests passing)
  - âœ… TaskService integration test suite (8 tests passing)
  - âœ… Test isolation with unique database files per test
  - âœ… Full CRUD operations, status updates, filtering, and cross-instance persistence

### Phase 4: Documentation and Migration
- [ ] **Create migration guide** for existing users
- [ ] **Update documentation** to reflect new backend options
- [ ] **Add CLI commands** for manual migration if needed

## Task Analysis Notes

### âœ… **Architecture Completed:**
The DatabaseStorage abstraction layer provides a clean separation between business logic and storage implementation. Key benefits:

1. **Type Safety**: Generic interfaces ensure compile-time type checking
2. **Future-Proof**: Easy to add SQLite or other backends later
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types and recovery mechanisms
4. **Performance**: Atomic operations and efficient JSON serialization

### âœ… **Migration Strategy Implemented:**
The migration utilities support:
- Converting existing `tasks.md` to centralized JSON database
- Backup creation for safety
- Bidirectional conversion for rollback scenarios
- Format comparison to detect synchronization issues

### ðŸ”„ **Current Progress:**
- Storage layer: 100% complete âœ…
- Migration utilities: 100% complete âœ… 
- JsonFileTaskBackend: 100% complete âœ…
- Testing: Comprehensive test suite complete âœ… (20 tests passing)
- Integration: 100% complete âœ…
- Linter compatibility: 100% resolved âœ…

### ðŸŽ¯ **Next Steps:**
1. âœ… Fix OS module import and bun:test compatibility issues - COMPLETED
2. âœ… Integrate JsonFileTaskBackend with existing TaskService - COMPLETED
3. Update CLI commands to work with new backend (optional - backward compatible)
4. Create migration documentation and guides
