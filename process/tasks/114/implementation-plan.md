# Implementation Plan: High-Priority Test Migration to Bun-native Patterns

## Objective

Migrate the most critical tests from legacy Jest/Vitest patterns to Bun-native test patterns for long-term stability and performance.

## Steps Taken

1. **Inventory and Prioritization**
   - Identified high-priority tests based on business criticality, CI frequency, and migration complexity.
2. **Pattern Library and Helpers**
   - Established a pattern library and custom helpers for Bun-native testing.
3. **Manual Migration**
   - Migrated all prioritized test files to Bun-native patterns.
   - Refactored test structure for clarity and maintainability.
4. **Verification**
   - Ensured all migrated tests pass under Bun.
   - Confirmed no legacy patterns remain in high-priority files.
5. **Documentation**
   - Documented migration patterns, helpers, and lessons learned.

## Verification Checklist

- [x] All high-priority tests migrated to Bun-native patterns
- [x] All migrated tests pass under Bun
- [x] No legacy Jest/Vitest patterns remain
- [x] Migration patterns and helpers documented
