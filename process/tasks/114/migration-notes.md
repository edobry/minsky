# Migration Notes for Task #114

This file tracks the progress and patterns identified during the migration of high-priority tests to native Bun patterns.

## Setup Progress

### Environment Setup (Completed)
- Created directory structure for migration documentation
- Ran updated test analysis to reflect current state
- Created migration criteria documentation
- Created migration template for consistent documentation
- Created prioritized migration backlog with rationale
- Established verification and success criteria

### Next Steps
- Begin migration of the first priority test (enhanced-utils.test.ts)
- Document patterns and challenges encountered
- Create reusable utilities for common patterns

## Migration Pattern Library

Below are common patterns encountered during migrations:

| Jest/Vitest Pattern | Bun Equivalent | Notes |
|---------------------|----------------|-------|
| `jest.fn()` | `mock()` | Basic function mocking |
| `jest.fn().mockReturnValue(x)` | `mock(() => x)` | Mocking return values |
| `jest.mock('module')` | `mock.module('module', () => {})` | Module mocking |
| `jest.spyOn(object, 'method')` | Custom spy implementation | Needs special handling |
| `beforeEach/afterEach` | `import { beforeEach, afterEach } from 'bun:test'` | Test lifecycle hooks |
