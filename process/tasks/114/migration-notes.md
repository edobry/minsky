# Migration Notes for Task #114

This file tracks the progress and patterns identified during the migration of high-priority tests to native Bun patterns.

## Setup Progress

### Environment Setup (Completed)
- Created directory structure for migration documentation
- Ran updated test analysis to reflect current state
- Created migration criteria documentation
- Created migration template for consistent documentation
- Created prioritized migration backlog with rationale
- Established verification and success criteria

### Recent Progress
- Created custom assertion helpers in `src/utils/test-utils/assertions.ts` to bridge Jest/Bun differences
- Added thorough tests for all assertion helpers
- Created a detailed assertion method migration guide
- Migrated enhanced-utils.test.ts with proper ESM imports
- Migrated mocking.test.ts with improved type safety and error verification
- Migrated filter-messages.test.ts with custom assertion helpers
- Migrated src/domain/__tests__/tasks.test.ts with centralized mocking utilities

### Next Steps
- Continue with migration of next priority test (src/domain/git.test.ts)
- Document patterns and challenges encountered
- Create reusable utilities for common patterns

## Migration Pattern Library

Below are common patterns encountered during migrations:

| Jest/Vitest Pattern | Bun Equivalent | Notes |
|---------------------|----------------|-------|
| `jest.fn()` | `createMock()` | Use centralized mocking utilities instead of direct Bun APIs |
| `jest.fn().mockReturnValue(x)` | `createMock(() => x)` | Mocking return values |
| `jest.mock('module')` | `mockModule('module', () => {})` | Module mocking |
| `jest.spyOn(object, 'method')` | `createSpyOn(object, 'method')` or `spyOn(object, 'method')` | Object method spying |
| `beforeEach/afterEach` | `import { beforeEach, afterEach } from 'bun:test'` | Test lifecycle hooks |
| Missing import extensions | `import from './file.js'` | ESM requires explicit extensions |
| `expect(x).toMatch(regex)` | `expect(x.match(regex)).toBeTruthy()` or `expectToMatch(x, regex)` | Regex matching - Bun doesn't have toMatch |
| `@ts-ignore` in tests | Type assertions `(x as any)` | Better type safety than ignoring errors |
| `expect(x).toHaveLength(n)` | `expectToHaveLength(x, n)` | Bun doesn't have toHaveLength |
| `mockFn.mockClear()` | `setupTestMocks()` | Automatic mock cleanup between tests |
| `expect(e instanceof Error)` | `expectToBeInstanceOf(e, Error)` | Type checking with custom helper |
| `mockFn.mockImplementationOnce()` | `mockFn.mockImplementation()` | Bun only has mockImplementation |
| `jest.restoreAllMocks()` | `mock.restore()` | Restoring mocked methods |
| `expect(x).toInclude(y)` | `expect(x.includes(y)).toBe(true)` | String inclusion checking |

## Custom Assertion Helpers

We've created a set of custom assertion helpers in `src/utils/test-utils/assertions.ts` to bridge the gap between Jest and Bun assertions:

| Jest/Vitest Method | Our Custom Helper | Notes |
|---------------------|----------------|-------|
| `expect(x).toMatch(regex)` | `expectToMatch(x, regex)` | For regex pattern matching |
| `expect(x).toHaveLength(n)` | `expectToHaveLength(x, n)` | For arrays and strings |
| `expect(x).toBeInstanceOf(Class)` | `expectToBeInstanceOf(x, Class)` | For instanceof checks |
| `expect(x).toHaveProperty(prop, value)` | `expectToHaveProperty(x, prop, value)` | For property existence checks |
| `expect(x).toBeCloseTo(n, precision)` | `expectToBeCloseTo(x, n, precision)` | For floating point comparisons |
| `expect(arr).toContainEqual(obj)` | `expectToContainEqual(arr, obj)` | For deep equality array item checks |

See the [assertion methods documentation](../../src/test-migration/examples/assertion-methods.md) for detailed usage examples.

## Lessons Learned

1. **ESM Import Requirements**
   - Bun uses ES Modules which require explicit file extensions in relative imports (e.g., `from './file.js'`)
   - Import changes are needed even when the test is already using Bun test patterns

2. **Lifecycle Hook Imports**
   - `beforeEach` and `afterEach` must be explicitly imported from `bun:test`
   - Global Jest equivalents are not available in Bun

3. **Assertion Method Differences**
   - Bun's test framework doesn't support all Jest assertion methods
   - `toMatch()` assertion method isn't available in Bun's expect
   - `toHaveLength()` assertion method isn't available in Bun's expect
   - Created custom assertion helpers that mirror Jest's assertion methods
   - Custom helpers provide type safety and familiar patterns for test writers

4. **Type Safety Improvements**
   - Replace `@ts-ignore` comments with proper type assertions (`as any`)
   - Add error type checking when working with exceptions (`if (e instanceof Error)`)
   - Use stronger typing in function parameters where possible
   - Using custom `expectToBeInstanceOf()` helper improves code readability

5. **Documentation Benefits**
   - Adding `@migrated` tags to JSDoc comments helps track migration status
   - Documenting migration patterns helps maintain consistency across the codebase

6. **Mock Cleanup Approach**
   - Bun doesn't have `mockClear()` or `mockReset()` methods
   - Use `setupTestMocks()` to automatically reset mocks between tests
   - This approach is cleaner than manually resetting mocks in `beforeEach`

7. **Mock Implementation Behavior**
   - Bun only has `mockImplementation()` without `mockImplementationOnce()`
   - Mock implementations persist between tests if not explicitly reset
   - Need to be mindful of test ordering and mock restoration
   - For tests that modify shared mocks, reset the mock to default state at the start of the test

8. **Direct Method Mocking**
   - Use `spyOn(Class.prototype, "methodName")` for direct method mocking
   - This approach is cleaner than mocking modules or dependencies
   - Bun's `spyOn` supports `mockImplementation` similar to Jest
   - Use `mock.restore()` in `afterEach` to clean up spies
   - Type handling with Typescript requires explicit unknown type on catch blocks
