# feat(#114): Migrate High-Priority Tests to Native Bun Patterns

## Summary

This PR completes the migration of 20 high-priority tests to native Bun test patterns, improving test reliability and performance. The migration includes creating custom assertion helpers, documenting migration patterns, and ensuring tests work consistently across the codebase.

## Changes

### Added

- Created robust custom assertion helpers to bridge Jest and Bun differences in `src/utils/test-utils/assertions.ts`
- Added `expectToMatch`, `expectToHaveLength`, `expectToBeInstanceOf`, `expectToNotBeNull`, `expectToHaveBeenCalled`, and other helpers
- Implemented comprehensive migration pattern library documenting common patterns between Jest and Bun

### Changed

- Migrated core utility tests to native Bun patterns, including:
  - Enhanced utility tests (enhanced-utils.test.ts)
  - Mocking utility tests (mocking.test.ts)
  - Filter messages utility tests (filter-messages.test.ts)
  - Core domain tests (tasks.test.ts, git.test.ts, git.pr.test.ts, session-db.test.ts)
  - Adapter command tests (rules.test.ts, tasks.test.ts, git.test.ts, session.test.ts)
  - CLI adapter tests (git-merge-pr.test.ts)
  - Utility tests (param-schemas.test.ts, option-descriptions.test.ts, compatibility.test.ts)
  - Integration tests (tasks.test.ts, git.test.ts, rules.test.ts, workspace.test.ts)
- Updated ESM imports to use .js extensions for compatibility with Bun's ESM loader
- Enhanced error handling with proper TypeScript types in test files

### Fixed

- Improved mock cleanup with explicit afterEach handlers
- Added proper method spying with Bun's native spyOn utility
- Fixed integration tests to use proper mocking patterns

## Testing

All migrated tests were run with Bun test runner and verified to pass with the same functionality as the original tests. The migration maintains test coverage and actually improves test reliability by using native Bun patterns.
