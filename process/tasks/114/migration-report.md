# Migration Report: High-Priority Test Migration to Bun-native Patterns

## Summary

All high-priority tests identified for Task #114 have been successfully migrated to Bun-native patterns. The migration improved test reliability, maintainability, and performance. No legacy Jest/Vitest patterns remain in the prioritized files.

## Outcomes

- **Tests migrated:** 12 high-priority/core test files
- **All migrated tests pass under Bun**
- **Test structure and readability improved**
- **Custom helpers and compatibility layers established**

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Mocking differences:** Addressed by using Bun's `mock`/`spyOn` and custom helpers.
- **Assertion differences:** Resolved with custom matchers and Bun's `expect`.
- **Setup/teardown:** Standardized with `beforeEach`/`afterEach`.

## Recommendations

- Use Bun-native patterns for all new and existing tests.
- Maintain and extend the pattern library and helpers as needed.
- Use this migration as a reference for future automated migrations.

## Artifacts

- See `migration-notes.md` and `implementation-plan.md` for details.
- See `src/utils/test-utils/` for helpers and compatibility layers.
