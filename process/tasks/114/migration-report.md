# Task #114: Test Migration Final Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the migration of 20 high-priority tests from Jest/Vitest patterns to native Bun test patterns. The migration was completed successfully with all tests passing and maintaining the same functionality and coverage as the original tests.

## Migration Statistics

- **Total tests migrated**: 20
- **Test files by difficulty**:
  - Easy: 14
  - Medium: 6
  - Hard: 0
- **Test files by type**:
  - Utility tests: 7
  - Domain tests: 4
  - Adapter tests: 9 (5 shared commands, 1 CLI, 3 integration)
- **Custom assertion helpers created**: 8
- **Migration patterns documented**: 9

## Common Migration Patterns

The following patterns were consistently applied across all migrated tests:

### 1. Import Statements

- Replace Jest/Vitest imports with Bun:test imports
- Add explicit imports for all test lifecycle hooks (beforeEach, afterEach)
- Use .js extensions for all local module imports

**Before:**

```ts
import { describe, it, expect, jest, beforeEach, afterEach } from "vitest";
import { someFunction } from "../module";
```

**After:**

```ts
import { describe, test, expect, mock, beforeEach, afterEach } from "bun:test";
import { someFunction } from "../module.js";
```

### 2. Test Function Naming

- Replace `it()` with `test()`
- Keep `describe()` usage the same

**Before:**

```ts
describe("Test Suite", () => {
  it("should do something", () => {
    // ...
  });
});
```

**After:**

```ts
describe("Test Suite", () => {
  test("should do something", () => {
    // ...
  });
});
```

### 3. Mocking

- Replace `jest.fn()` with `mock()`
- Replace `jest.mock()` with `mockModule()`
- Use the custom `createMock()` function for better type safety
- Always clean up mocks in afterEach with `setupTestMocks()` or manual cleanup

**Before:**

```ts
jest.mock("../module", () => ({
  someFunction: jest.fn().mockReturnValue("mocked"),
}));

const mockFn = jest.fn();
```

**After:**

```ts
import { createMock, mockModule, setupTestMocks } from "../../utils/test-utils/mocking.js";

// Set up automatic mock cleanup
setupTestMocks();

const mockFn = createMock();
mockModule("../module.js", () => ({
  someFunction: mockFn.mockReturnValue("mocked"),
}));
```

### 4. Spy Functions

- Replace `jest.spyOn()` with Bun's `spyOn()`
- Use clear class structure for method spying with prototype access

**Before:**

```ts
const spy = jest.spyOn(object, "method");
```

**After:**

```ts
import { spyOn } from "bun:test";

const spy = spyOn(Object.prototype, "method");
```

### 5. Assertions

- Replace Jest matchers with Bun equivalents or custom helpers
- Use our custom assertion helpers for missing matchers

**Before:**

```ts
expect(array).toHaveLength(3);
expect(obj).toBeInstanceOf(Class);
expect(value).not.toBeNull();
```

**After:**

```ts
import {
  expectToHaveLength,
  expectToBeInstanceOf,
  expectToNotBeNull,
} from "../../utils/test-utils/assertions.js";

expectToHaveLength(array, 3);
expectToBeInstanceOf(obj, Class);
expectToNotBeNull(value);
```

### 6. Error Handling

- Add explicit type annotations in catch blocks
- Use proper type narrowing with instanceof checks

**Before:**

```ts
try {
  await functionThatThrows();
} catch (error) {
  expect(error.message).toBe("Error message");
}
```

**After:**

```ts
try {
  await functionThatThrows();
} catch (error: unknown) {
  if (error instanceof Error) {
    expect(error.message).toBe("Error message");
  } else {
    throw error;
  }
}
```

## Custom Assertion Helpers

The following custom assertion helpers were created to bridge the gap between Jest and Bun:

1. `expectToMatch(actual, expected)` - For `expect(actual).toMatch(expected)`
2. `expectToHaveLength(actual, expected)` - For `expect(actual).toHaveLength(expected)`
3. `expectToBeInstanceOf(actual, expected)` - For `expect(actual).toBeInstanceOf(expected)`
4. `expectToNotBeNull(actual)` - For `expect(actual).not.toBeNull()`
5. `expectToHaveProperty(actual, property)` - For `expect(actual).toHaveProperty(property)`
6. `expectToHaveBeenCalled(mockFn)` - For `expect(mockFn).toHaveBeenCalled()`
7. `expectToHaveBeenCalledWith(mockFn, ...args)` - For `expect(mockFn).toHaveBeenCalledWith(...args)`
8. `getMockCallArg(mockFn, callIndex, argIndex)` - Helper to safely access mock call arguments

## Lessons Learned

1. **Type Safety Improvements**

   - The migration process helped identify and fix several type safety issues in the codebase
   - Bun's stricter type checking enforced better practices, especially with error handling

2. **Mock Cleanup Importance**

   - Explicit mock cleanup in afterEach is crucial for test isolation
   - The setupTestMocks() helper significantly simplified this process

3. **Custom Helpers Value**

   - Creating custom assertion helpers proved more maintainable than using inline workarounds
   - The helpers make future migrations much easier by providing a consistent pattern

4. **ESM Import Consistency**
   - Using .js extensions for all imports is necessary for Bun's ESM loader
   - This should be enforced via ESLint to prevent future issues

## Recommendations for Future Migrations

1. **Automated Migration Tool**

   - Develop a script to automate common patterns like import changes and .js extension addition
   - Create pattern matching for common Jest matchers to convert to our custom helpers

2. **Testing Standards Update**

   - Update testing standards documentation to require:
     - Explicit import of all lifecycle hooks
     - Use of setupTestMocks() in all test files
     - Consistent error handling with type annotations
     - Use of custom assertion helpers instead of inline workarounds

3. **ESLint Rule Updates**

   - Add ESLint rules to enforce:
     - .js extensions on all local imports
     - No direct use of deprecated Jest patterns
     - Proper error type handling in catch blocks

4. **Remaining Test Migrations**
   - Prioritize migrating domain tests next, as they contain the most critical business logic
   - Create a migration schedule with regular checkpoints to ensure progress

## Next Steps

1. Enforce the use of ESLint rules for proper import patterns
2. Continue the migration of the remaining lower-priority tests
3. Implement automated test migration tooling
4. Update testing documentation with migration patterns and best practices

## Conclusion

The migration of 20 high-priority tests to native Bun patterns was successful, with all tests maintaining their functionality while improving type safety and test isolation. The patterns and helpers established during this migration provide a solid foundation for migrating the remaining tests in the codebase.
