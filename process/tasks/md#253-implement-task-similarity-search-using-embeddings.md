## Description

# Extend Task Embeddings Infrastructure for General Task Metadata Storage

## Context

**âœ… PHASE 1 COMPLETED ([PR #89](https://github.com/edobry/minsky/pull/89))**: Task similarity search using embeddings has been successfully implemented with PostgreSQL + pgvector, reusing the existing session database infrastructure.

**Current Implementation Includes:**
- âœ… Task similarity search: `minsky tasks similar <task-id>`
- âœ… Natural language task search: `minsky tasks search <query>`  
- âœ… Embedding indexing: `minsky tasks index-embeddings [--task <id>]`
- âœ… PostgreSQL + pgvector storage using session database connection
- âœ… OpenAI embedding service with configurable providers
- âœ… `task_embeddings` table with pgvector support

**NEXT PHASE**: Extend the existing `task_embeddings` infrastructure to support **general task metadata storage**, fulfilling the architectural vision from Task #315 (spec/metadata separation) while preserving existing embeddings data.

## Current Architecture (Post-PR #89)

### Database Schema (task_embeddings table)
```sql
CREATE TABLE task_embeddings (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,              -- UUID or generated ID
  task_id TEXT,                     -- Task ID (may be legacy format: "123" vs "md#123")
  dimension INT NOT NULL,           -- Embedding dimension (e.g., 1536)
  embedding vector(dimension),      -- pgvector embedding
  metadata JSONB,                   -- Currently used for embedding metadata
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Configuration (Current)
```toml
[vectorStorage]
backend = "postgres"              # or "memory" 
useSessionDb = true               # Default: reuse session DB connection

[embeddings]
provider = "openai"               # or "local"
model = "text-embedding-3-small"  # Default embedding model
```

### Services Implemented
- **TaskSimilarityService**: Core similarity search logic
- **PostgresVectorStorage**: pgvector-based storage using session DB
- **MemoryVectorStorage**: In-memory storage for development
- **OpenAIEmbeddingService**: OpenAI-based embedding generation
- **LocalEmbeddingService**: Local/offline embedding support

## Dependencies

1. **Task #160**: âœ… **DONE** - AI completion backend (used for embedding generation)
2. **Task #182**: âœ… **DONE** - AI service patterns (used in similarity service)
3. **Task #315**: âœ… **PARTIALLY DONE** - External task database foundation (needs completion)

## Current Limitations & Opportunities

### ðŸš§ Issues to Address

1. **Legacy Task ID Format**: Some embeddings use unqualified task IDs ("123" vs "md#123")
2. **Limited Metadata Support**: `metadata` field currently only stores embedding metadata
3. **No General Task Metadata**: Missing the spec/metadata separation from Task #315
4. **Single-Purpose Schema**: Table designed only for embeddings, not general metadata

### ðŸŽ¯ Extension Opportunity

The existing `task_embeddings` table provides the perfect foundation for general task metadata storage:
- âœ… Already uses session database (PostgreSQL/SQLite infrastructure)
- âœ… Has JSONB metadata field that can be expanded
- âœ… Contains task_id linkage for cross-referencing
- âœ… Has proper timestamps and versioning

## Objective

**PHASE 2 GOAL**: Transform the existing `task_embeddings` table into a unified **task metadata and embeddings storage system**, achieving the spec/metadata separation architecture from Task #315 while preserving all existing embedding functionality.

**Key Outcomes:**
1. **Preserve Existing Functionality**: All current similarity search features continue working
2. **Extend Metadata Storage**: Support general task metadata (dependencies, subtasks, provenance)
3. **Handle Legacy Task IDs**: Migrate and normalize task ID formats
4. **Enable Hybrid Workflows**: Support the GitHub Issues + local metadata workflow from Task #315

## Technical Implementation

### Embedding-Based Similarity Analysis

Using OpenAI embeddings via existing AI completion infrastructure:

1. **Task Content Processing:**

   - Extract meaningful content from task titles, descriptions, and specifications
   - Handle structured content (markdown, code blocks, lists)
   - Content chunking for large tasks
   - Normalize text for consistent embedding generation

2. **Embedding Generation:**

   - Leverage existing `DefaultAICompletionService` for provider management
   - Start with OpenAI text-embedding-3-small for cost efficiency
   - Easily configurable for other providers (OpenAI large, future providers)
   - Batch processing for efficient API usage
   - Error handling and retry logic

3. **SQLite Vector Architecture:**

   - **sqlite-vec virtual tables**: Store vectors as native SQLite columns with type safety
   - **Multiple vector formats**: float32 (standard), int8 (quantized), bit (binary)
   - **Distance metrics**: L2 (Euclidean), L1 (Manhattan), cosine, Hamming (for binary)
   - **SIMD acceleration**: AVX/NEON optimized distance calculations
   - **Native SQL KNN**: `WHERE vector MATCH ? ORDER BY distance LIMIT k`

### Task Search Service Architecture

Building on proven patterns from Task #182:

1. **Service Design:**

   ```typescript
   interface EmbeddingService {
     generateEmbedding(content: string): Promise<number[]>;
     generateEmbeddings(contents: string[]): Promise<number[][]>;
   }

   interface VectorStorage {
     store(id: string, vector: number[], metadata?: any): Promise<void>;
     search(queryVector: number[], limit?: number, threshold?: number): Promise<SearchResult[]>;
     delete(id: string): Promise<void>;
   }

   class TaskSimilarityService {
     constructor(
       private embeddingService: EmbeddingService,
       private vectorStorage: VectorStorage,
       private taskService: TaskService
     ) {}
   }
   ```

2. **Provider Abstraction:**

   - OpenAI embedding service implementation using existing AI config
   - Easy addition of other providers (Cohere, OpenSource models)
   - Fallback to keyword search when embedding service unavailable
   - Configuration-driven provider selection

3. **Storage Abstraction:**

   - In-memory storage for development and testing
   - Interface designed for easy migration to persistent storage
   - Support for incremental updates and bulk operations
   - Metadata storage for task context and timestamps

### Integration with Task Management

   - Seamless integration with existing TaskService
   - Support for all task backends (JSON, database, GitHub Issues)
   - Consistent API across different storage backends

2. **Real-time Updates:**

   - Integration with existing task creation and management workflows
   - Support for both interactive and programmatic usage

## Use Cases

minsky tasks check-duplicate 123
```

### 2. Project Planning and Dependencies

```bash
# Find tasks that should be completed before a task
minsky tasks suggest-blockers 150

# Discover related tasks for sprint planning
minsky tasks similar 200 --threshold=0.6

# Analyze task relationships for project health
minsky tasks analyze-relationships --export=report.json
```

### 3. Task Maintenance and Cleanup

```bash
# Find potential duplicate tasks
minsky tasks find-duplicates --threshold=0.8

# Group related tasks for better organization
minsky tasks cluster --min-cluster-size=3

# Find orphaned or unrelated tasks
minsky tasks analyze-relationships --find-orphans
```

### 4. Enhanced Task Discovery

```bash

minsky tasks search "authentication security login"

# Discover tasks similar to current work
minsky tasks similar $(minsky session get --current-task)

# Find tasks that might be relevant to a new feature
