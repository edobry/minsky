- **Add PR description**
- **Enforces immediate push after commit**
  
  Updates the Minsky workflow documentation to emphasize the critical importance of immediately pushing commits after they are made.  
  
This ensures data consistency and avoids potential conflicts when working on tasks and sessions.
- **Adds ESLint for linting and formatting**
  
  Sets up ESLint with recommended TypeScript rules for code linting and formatting.  
  
Adds lint and lint:fix scripts to the package.json for easy execution.
- **Adds repository backend support**
  
  Introduces repository backend support, enabling the use of different repository sources such as local Git and GitHub.  
  
This adds a new task (#014) that defines the requirements, implementation steps, and verification for this feature. It also includes a backend interface, session integration, GitHub backend implementation, CLI updates, and configuration options.
- **Adds task for `session delete` command**
  
  Adds a task specification for a new `session delete` command to remove session repos and records.  
  
The task includes requirements for CLI behavior, domain integration, safety features, implementation steps, and verification. It also updates the `process/tasks.md` file with the new task.
- **Adds task workspace enforcement**
  
  Ensures all task management operations are executed within the main workspace, regardless of the current directory. This prevents inconsistencies and ensures task-related files are consistently managed. Creates a new task to define this feature and updates the task list.
- **feat(#001): Add Task ID Support to Session Start Command**
  
  ## Overview  
This PR implements task #001, adding support for associating sessions with tasks in the `minsky session start` command. The implementation allows users to start a session with a task ID, which automatically names the session after the task and stores the task ID in the session record.  
  
## Changes  
1. Enhanced `session start` command:  
   - Added `--task <task-id>` option  
   - Task ID validation using TaskService  
   - Session naming based on task ID (e.g., `task#001`)  
   - Task ID stored in session record  
   - Error handling for missing/duplicate tasks  
  
2. Fixed test issues:  
   - Improved git PR test reliability by adding better error handling and cleanup  
   - Fixed timeout issues in git PR test  
   - Added tests for task ID functionality  
  
## Testing  
- All tests passing  
- Added new tests for task ID functionality  
- Fixed reliability issues in git PR tests  
  
## Documentation  
- Updated README with task ID examples  
- Updated CHANGELOG with new functionality  
  
## Verification  
- [x] Can start a session with a freeform name as before  
- [x] Can start a session with `--task <task-id>`  
- [x] Session is named after the task ID  
- [x] Task ID is stored in session record  
- [x] Errors out if task does not exist  
- [x] Errors out if session for task already exists  
- [x] All tests passing  
- [x] Documentation updated

- **Fixes session creation order of operations**
  
  Corrects the order of database and git operations during  
session creation. The session is now added to the database  
*before* cloning and branching, preventing "Session not found"  
errors.  
  
Includes a new test case to verify the correct sequence of  
operations.

- **feat(#016): Enforce Task Operations in Main Workspace**
  
  ## Overview  
  
This PR implements automatic workspace detection for task operations. Now, when a task command is executed from a session repository, Minsky automatically detects this and performs the operation on the main workspace instead of the session-specific copy.  
  
## Changes  
  
1. Created a new workspace utility module (`src/domain/workspace.ts`) with functions to:  
   - Detect if running in a session repository  
   - Resolve the main workspace path from a session repository  
   - Handle file:// URLs in workspace paths  
  
2. Updated TaskService and TaskBackend interfaces to use workspace paths:  
   - Changed constructor parameter from `repoPath` to `workspacePath`  
   - Added `getWorkspacePath()` method to both interfaces  
   - Updated implementations to use workspace paths  
  
3. Modified all task commands to use workspace detection:  
   - Added `--workspace` option to all task commands  
   - Updated command handlers to resolve the main workspace path  
   - Used detected workspace path for all task operations  
  
4. Added comprehensive documentation in README.md  
  
## Benefits  
  
- Task operations are now consistent regardless of where they're executed from  
- No manual directory changes are needed when working in session repositories  
- Transparent to users - everything just works as expected  
  
## Testing  
  
Created a test script that demonstrates the functionality - changing task status from a session repository correctly updates the main workspace.  
  
## Future Improvements  
  
- Add caching for workspace path resolution  
- Consider adding similar workspace detection for other command types
- **commit specstory**
- **Add rule for testing session repository changes**
- **feat(#015): add delete command to remove session repos and records**
  
  ## Overview  
This PR implements a new `session delete` command that allows users to cleanly remove sessions and their associated repositories through the Minsky CLI. Prior to this change, users had to manually delete session repositories and update the session database, which was error-prone and tedious.  
  
## Implementation  
- Added `deleteSession` method to the `SessionDB` class in the domain layer  
- Created a new command module in `src/commands/session/delete.ts`  
- Registered the command in the session command index  
- Added comprehensive tests for both domain and CLI functionality  
- Updated the CHANGELOG.md to document the new feature  
  
## Features  
The new command supports the following functionality:  
- Removes the session repository directory from the filesystem  
- Deletes the session record from the session database  
- Provides clear feedback on the deletion status  
- Includes robust error handling for various failure scenarios  
  
### Command Options  
- `--force`: Skips the confirmation prompt (useful for scripting)  
- `--json`: Outputs results in JSON format for programmatic consumption  
  
## Error Handling  
The command gracefully handles various error scenarios:  
- Non-existent sessions  
- File system errors during repository deletion  
- Database errors during record removal  
- Partial failures with appropriate rollback  
  
## Usage Examples  
```bash  
# Basic usage with confirmation prompt  
minsky session delete my-session  
  
# Skip confirmation prompt  
minsky session delete my-session --force  
  
# Get machine-readable JSON output  
minsky session delete my-session --json  
```  
  
## Testing  
Tests have been added at two levels:  
1. **Domain tests**: Verify the `deleteSession` method works correctly in isolation  
2. **CLI tests**: Ensure the command properly handles user interaction, options, and error cases  
  
All tests pass successfully, and the implementation has been manually verified.
