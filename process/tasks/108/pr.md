# refactor(#108): Refactor TaskService to Functional Patterns

## Summary

This PR refactors the TaskService and associated backend implementations to follow functional programming patterns, as part of the larger domain object refactoring (task #102). It separates pure functions from side effects, makes state transformations explicit, and improves testability.

## Changes

### Added

- Added new type definitions for task data structures
- Created pure function modules for task operations
- Added I/O operations module to isolate side effects
- Added extensive unit tests for the new pure functions

### Changed

- Refactored TaskBackend interface to separate data retrieval, pure operations, and side effects
- Refactored MarkdownTaskBackend implementation to use the functional approach
- Updated TaskService to orchestrate pure functions and side effect handlers
- Updated interface-agnostic command functions to work with the new approach
- Updated existing tests to work with the functional architecture

### Fixed

- Improved error handling with more explicit error states
- Fixed potential issues with task ID normalization
- Fixed inconsistencies in task status handling

## Testing

The changes have been tested with:
- Unit tests for all pure functions, verifying their behavior with various inputs
- Integration tests verifying the correct interaction between components
- Manual testing of the CLI commands to ensure backward compatibility

## Checklist

- [x] All requirements implemented
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] Code quality is acceptable
- [x] Documentation is updated
- [x] Changelog is updated
