# refactor(#108): Refactor TaskService to Functional Patterns

## Summary

This PR implements task #108, which refactors the TaskService and associated backend implementations to follow functional programming patterns. It separates pure functions from side effects, makes state transformations explicit, and improves testability.

## Motivation & Context

The current TaskService implementation mixes pure logic with side effects, making it difficult to test and reason about. This refactoring is part of the larger domain object refactoring (task #102) effort to improve code quality and maintainability across the codebase.

## Design/Approach

We've implemented a functional approach that:

1. Separates pure functions (data transformations) from I/O operations (side effects)
2. Uses explicit data flow rather than implicit state changes
3. Improves error handling with more explicit error states
4. Enhances testability with pure function unit tests
5. Maintains backward compatibility with existing interface

## Key Changes

- Added new type definitions in `src/types/tasks/taskData.ts` for task data structures
- Created pure function module in `src/domain/tasks/taskFunctions.ts` with functions that:
  - Have no side effects
  - Return transformed data instead of modifying in place
  - Have clear input/output contracts
- Added I/O operations module in `src/domain/tasks/taskIO.ts` to isolate side effects
- Refactored `TaskBackend` interface with clear separation of:
  - Data retrieval (I/O)
  - Pure operations (transformations)
  - Side effect handling (saving)
- Updated `MarkdownTaskBackend` implementation to use the functional approach
- Refactored `TaskService` to orchestrate pure functions and side effect handlers
- Updated interface-agnostic command functions to work with the new approach
- Added extensive unit tests for the new pure functions

## Testing

The changes have been tested with:

- Unit tests for all pure functions in `taskFunctions.test.ts`
- Integration tests for `TaskService` in `taskService.test.ts`
- Tests verify both the behavior of individual functions and the correct integration between components
- Manual testing of the CLI commands to ensure backward compatibility
