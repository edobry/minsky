## Status

BACKLOG

## Priority

MEDIUM

## Description

Enhance Minsky's task management system to support subtasks, task dependencies, and hierarchical task structures. This foundational enhancement will enable more sophisticated project planning, execution tracking, and workflow orchestration.

## Vision Overview

Transform Minsky from discrete task management to a sophisticated hierarchical task system supporting:

1. **Immediate**: Explicit subtasks with parent-child relationships
2. **Medium-term**: Arbitrary depth task graphs with dependencies
3. **Long-term**: Planning vs execution separation with fractal planning/execution/review
4. **Future**: Custom visualization and advanced workflow orchestration

## Context & Alignment

This enhancement builds on Minsky's existing strengths:

- **Task #175**: AI-powered task decomposition provides natural subtask creation
- **Multi-backend architecture**: Extensible foundation for enhanced data models
- **Session management**: Natural boundary for planning vs execution separation
- **Interface-agnostic design**: Supports future UI and visualization development

## High-Level Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Subtasks & Parent-Child Relationships)

**Goal**: Enable explicit subtask relationships while maintaining backward compatibility

**Key Components**:

- Extend task data model to include parent/child relationships
- Update task backends to support hierarchical data
- Add CLI commands for subtask management
- Preserve existing task workflow compatibility

### Phase 2: Task Dependencies & Basic Graphs

**Goal**: Support task dependency relationships and basic workflow sequencing

**Key Components**:

- Add dependency relationships between tasks
- Implement dependency validation and cycle detection
- Create dependency-aware task listing and filtering
- Basic workflow visualization (text-based)

### Phase 3: Enhanced Planning/Execution Separation

**Goal**: Separate planning activities from execution activities

**Key Components**:

- Distinguish between planning tasks and execution tasks
- Enhanced session management for planning vs execution workflows
- Integration with AI-powered decomposition for automated planning
- Planning checkpoints and review cycles

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Visualization

**Goal**: Advanced workflow features and custom visualization

**Key Components**:

- Database migration for complex task relationships
- Custom visualization interface (web-based)
- Advanced planning workflows with AI assistance
- Integration with external project management tools

## Technical Approach

### Backward Compatibility Strategy

- All changes must maintain existing task workflow compatibility
- Gradual migration path from current flat task structure
- Legacy task support alongside enhanced hierarchical features

### Data Model Evolution

- Extend existing TaskData interface incrementally
- Leverage existing backend abstraction for storage flexibility
- Design for future database migration without breaking current workflows

### AI Integration Alignment

- Build on Task #175 AI decomposition capabilities
- Use AI for subtask generation and dependency suggestion
- Integrate with existing AI backend infrastructure

### Architecture Consistency

- Follow Minsky's interface-agnostic command architecture
- Maintain domain/adapter separation patterns
- Extend existing multi-backend task system

- Create web-based interactive task graph visualization
- Develop RESTful API for external integrations
- Build planning dashboard and execution tracking interfaces
- External integrations (GitHub, Linear, Jira, Notion)

- **Phase 2**: Dependency fields (dependencies.prerequisite, optional, related, blocks)
- **Phase 3**: Workflow fields (taskType, executionContext, checkpoints)
- **Phase 4**: Database schema with full relationship modeling

#### CLI Command Progression

- **Phase 1**: create-subtask, list --hierarchical, move, detach
- **Phase 2**: add-dependency, graph, critical-path, validate-dependencies
