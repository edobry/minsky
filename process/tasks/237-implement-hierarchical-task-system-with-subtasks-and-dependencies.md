# Implement Hierarchical Task System with Subtasks and Dependencies

## Status

BACKLOG

## Priority

MEDIUM

## Description

Enhance Minsky's task management system to support subtasks, task dependencies, and hierarchical task structures. This foundational enhancement will enable more sophisticated project planning, execution tracking, and workflow orchestration.

## Vision Overview

Transform Minsky from discrete task management to a sophisticated hierarchical task system supporting:

1. **Immediate**: Explicit subtasks with parent-child relationships
2. **Medium-term**: Arbitrary depth task graphs with dependencies  
3. **Long-term**: Planning vs execution separation with fractal planning/execution/review
4. **Future**: Custom visualization and advanced workflow orchestration

## Context & Alignment

This enhancement builds on Minsky's existing strengths:
- **Task #175**: AI-powered task decomposition provides natural subtask creation
- **Multi-backend architecture**: Extensible foundation for enhanced data models
- **Session management**: Natural boundary for planning vs execution separation
- **Interface-agnostic design**: Supports future UI and visualization development

## High-Level Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Subtasks & Parent-Child Relationships)
**Goal**: Enable explicit subtask relationships while maintaining backward compatibility

**Key Components**:
- Extend task data model to include parent/child relationships
- Update task backends to support hierarchical data
- Add CLI commands for subtask management
- Preserve existing task workflow compatibility

### Phase 2: Task Dependencies & Basic Graphs
**Goal**: Support task dependency relationships and basic workflow sequencing

**Key Components**:
- Add dependency relationships between tasks
- Implement dependency validation and cycle detection
- Create dependency-aware task listing and filtering
- Basic workflow visualization (text-based)

### Phase 3: Enhanced Planning/Execution Separation
**Goal**: Separate planning activities from execution activities

**Key Components**:
- Distinguish between planning tasks and execution tasks
- Enhanced session management for planning vs execution workflows
- Integration with AI-powered decomposition for automated planning
- Planning checkpoints and review cycles

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Visualization
**Goal**: Advanced workflow features and custom visualization

**Key Components**:
- Database migration for complex task relationships
- Custom visualization interface (web-based)
- Advanced planning workflows with AI assistance
- Integration with external project management tools

## Technical Approach

### Backward Compatibility Strategy
- All changes must maintain existing task workflow compatibility
- Gradual migration path from current flat task structure
- Legacy task support alongside enhanced hierarchical features

### Data Model Evolution
- Extend existing TaskData interface incrementally
- Leverage existing backend abstraction for storage flexibility
- Design for future database migration without breaking current workflows

### AI Integration Alignment
- Build on Task #175 AI decomposition capabilities
- Use AI for subtask generation and dependency suggestion
- Integrate with existing AI backend infrastructure

### Architecture Consistency
- Follow Minsky's interface-agnostic command architecture
- Maintain domain/adapter separation patterns
- Extend existing multi-backend task system

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- Users can create subtasks with explicit parent relationships
- Hierarchical task listing shows parent-child structure
- All existing task workflows continue to function unchanged
- AI decomposition can automatically create subtask relationships

### Long-term Success Criteria  
- Complex project workflows can be modeled as task graphs
- Planning and execution are cleanly separated with checkpointing
- Multiple levels of planning/execution/review are supported
- Custom visualization provides clear project workflow overview

## Implementation Priority

This enhancement should be implemented iteratively with user feedback at each phase, ensuring each increment provides immediate value while building toward the complete vision.
