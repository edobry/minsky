# Dependency Injection Enhancement for Test Reliability

## Context

## Overview

**MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Standardize dependency injection patterns across domain functions to reduce global state dependencies and improve test reliability.

## Problem Statement

Current codebase has inconsistent dependency injection patterns leading to:

- **Global State Dependencies**: Some functions rely on global imports rather than injected dependencies
- **Hard-to-Test Functions**: Functions that are difficult to test due to hidden dependencies
- **Inconsistent Patterns**: Mixed approaches to dependency management across the codebase
- **Test Setup Complexity**: Complex test setup due to implicit dependencies

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All core domain functions use dependency injection pattern
- [ ] Zero functions with hidden global dependencies
- [ ] Standard service interfaces defined for all major services
- [ ] Mock factory functions available for all services
- [ ] Test setup simplified due to explicit dependencies
- [ ] 100% of domain functions testable without global mocks
- [ ] Pattern documented and enforced via TypeScript types

## Benefits

- **Test Reliability**: Explicit dependencies make testing predictable
- **Isolation**: Functions can be tested in complete isolation
- **Maintainability**: Clear dependencies make code easier to understand
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap implementations for different environments
- **Debugging**: Easier to trace dependencies and debug issues

## Notes

- This builds on the successful dependency injection patterns already present
- Focus on standardization rather than complete rewriting
- Pattern should become standard for all new development
- Improves testability without sacrificing functionality
