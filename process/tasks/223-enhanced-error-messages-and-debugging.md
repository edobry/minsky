## Description

Improve error messages based on specific failures encountered in Task 209: 1) 'Cannot run session pr from PR branch' should suggest switching to session branch, 2) Task ID parsing errors should show supported formats (numeric vs alphanumeric), 3) Variable naming errors should point to specific declaration vs usage mismatches, 4) Git command hanging should timeout with helpful messages, 5) Merge conflict errors should identify specific conflicting files and suggest resolution strategies, 6) Backend detection failures should show available backends and configuration requirements.
