# Task 136: Fix all ESLint warnings and errors across the codebase

## Progress Log (Session: fix-task-status-errors)

### Completed
- Verified and switched to session workspace, using absolute paths for all edits per session-first-workflow.
- Fixed all console statement errors in:
  - debug-mcp.js
  - detect-placeholder-tests.ts
  - final-test.js
- Used `log.cli`, `log.debug`, and `log.error` as appropriate.
- Addressed type issues for process exit in Bun scripts (using `(process as any).exit`).
- Left only warnings (magic numbers, any type assertions) in these files.

### Next Steps
- Continue fixing console statement errors in remaining files flagged by ESLint.
- After console issues, address `no-explicit-any` and `no-unused-vars` errors.
- Document any complex or unresolvable issues in the task spec.

### Notes
- All changes are being made in the session workspace using absolute paths.
- Warnings for magic numbers and any type assertions are being left for now unless they are critical.
- Progress is being tracked and committed after each logical group of fixes.
