# Research codemod-based approach for session-aware edit file tool

## Context

Investigate replacing the current patch-style diff approach in the session-aware edit file tool with a codemod-based approach that precisely targets code replacements. This is a research-only task to analyze feasibility, benefits, and implementation considerations.

## Current State Analysis Needed

The current session-aware edit file tool uses a patch-style diff format similar to Cursor's built-in tool:
- Agent submits content with `// ... existing code ...` comments
- New code is interspersed between existing code markers  
- Sent to a "fast apply bottle" for automated application
- Can have ambiguity issues in locating exact edit positions

## Research Objectives

1. **Current Tool Analysis**: Deep dive into how the existing session-aware edit tool works, including the "fast apply bottle" mechanism
2. **Codemod Approach Modeling**: Design how a codemod-based approach would work in practice
3. **Precision Comparison**: Analyze how codemod targeting could eliminate ambiguity
4. **Technical Feasibility**: Assess implementation complexity and requirements
5. **Performance Implications**: Compare execution speed and resource usage
6. **Error Handling**: Model how errors and edge cases would be handled
7. **Integration Points**: Identify how this would integrate with existing MCP tools

## Specific Research Areas

### Codemod Design Patterns
- AST-based targeting vs string-based replacement
- How to handle context-aware replacements
- Dealing with formatting and whitespace preservation
- Handling multiple edits in a single file

### Precision Analysis
- Cases where current patch-style approach fails or is ambiguous
- How codemod targeting could provide exact positioning
- Handling of similar code patterns in the same file
- Edge cases with dynamic or generated code

### Implementation Architecture
- How agent would generate targeted codemods
- Integration with existing session file operations
- Compatibility with current MCP tool interface
- Fallback mechanisms for complex edits

### Performance & Usability
- Speed comparison: patch application vs codemod execution
- Resource usage implications
- Agent cognitive load in writing codemods vs patches
- Error message clarity and debugging

## Success Criteria

- Comprehensive analysis document comparing both approaches
- Proof-of-concept design for codemod-based tool interface
- Identified pros/cons with specific examples
- Recommendation on whether to pursue implementation
- If recommended, detailed implementation roadmap

## Constraints

- **NO IMPLEMENTATION**: Research and analysis only
- Focus on session-aware edit tool specifically
- Consider backward compatibility requirements
- Analyze impact on existing workflows
