# Research codemod-based approach for session-aware edit file tool

## Status

TODO

## Priority

MEDIUM

## Description

Investigate replacing the current patch-style diff approach in the session-aware edit file tool with a codemod-based approach that precisely targets code replacements. This is a research-only task to analyze feasibility, benefits, and implementation considerations.

## Background & Motivation

The current session-aware edit file tool uses a patch-style diff format similar to Cursor's built-in tool:

- Agent submits content with `// ... existing code ...` comments
- New code is interspersed between existing code markers
- Sent to a "fast apply model" for automated application
- Can have ambiguity issues in locating exact edit positions

A codemod-based approach could potentially provide more precision by having the agent write targeted transformations that explicitly specify what code to replace with what new code, eliminating ambiguity about edit locations.

## Research Objectives

### 1. Current Tool Analysis

- Deep dive into how the existing session-aware edit tool works
- Understand the "fast apply model" mechanism and its limitations
- Document current failure modes and ambiguity issues
- Analyze performance characteristics and resource usage

### 2. Codemod Approach Modeling

- Design how a codemod-based approach would work in practice
- Define agent interface for generating targeted codemods
- Model integration with existing MCP tool architecture
- Consider different codemod targeting strategies (AST vs string-based)

### 3. Precision & Reliability Analysis

- Compare accuracy of current patch-style vs proposed codemod approach
- Identify cases where current approach fails or is ambiguous
- Model how codemod targeting could eliminate positioning issues
- Analyze handling of edge cases (similar code patterns, dynamic content)

### 4. Technical Feasibility Assessment

- Evaluate implementation complexity requirements
- Assess compatibility with current MCP tool interface
- Consider performance implications and execution speed
- Design fallback mechanisms for complex edits

### 5. Integration Architecture

- Model how this would integrate with existing session file operations
- Consider backward compatibility requirements
- Design error handling and debugging capabilities
- Assess impact on existing workflows and agent patterns

## Specific Research Areas

### Codemod Design Patterns

- AST-based targeting vs string-based replacement strategies
- Context-aware replacement handling approaches
- Formatting and whitespace preservation techniques
- Multi-edit coordination within single files

### Precision Analysis Examples

- Document specific cases where patch-style approach has failed
- Model exact positioning capabilities of codemod targeting
- Analyze disambiguation of similar code patterns
- Edge case handling for generated or dynamic code

### Implementation Architecture Options

- Agent codemod generation interface design
- MCP tool integration patterns
- Session workspace file operation compatibility
- Error recovery and rollback mechanisms

### Performance & Usability Considerations

- Execution speed: patch application vs codemod running
- Resource usage comparison and scalability
- Agent cognitive load: writing codemods vs patches
- Error message clarity and developer debugging experience

## Success Criteria

- **Comprehensive Analysis Document**: Detailed comparison of both approaches with specific examples
- **Proof-of-Concept Design**: Concrete interface design for codemod-based tool
- **Pros/Cons Matrix**: Structured evaluation with quantified trade-offs where possible
- **Implementation Recommendation**: Clear recommendation on whether to pursue implementation
- **Roadmap (if recommended)**: Detailed implementation plan with milestones and risk assessment

## Constraints & Scope

- **NO IMPLEMENTATION**: Research, analysis, and design only
- **Focus Area**: Session-aware edit tool specifically (not general edit tools)
- **Compatibility**: Must consider backward compatibility requirements
- **Workflow Impact**: Analyze effects on existing agent and user workflows

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Current tool behavior and limitations are thoroughly documented
- [ ] Codemod-based approach is modeled with concrete examples
- [ ] Precision comparison includes specific failure case analysis
- [ ] Technical feasibility assessment covers implementation complexity
- [ ] Performance implications are quantified where possible
- [ ] Integration architecture is designed with existing systems
- [ ] Clear recommendation is provided with supporting evidence
- [ ] If implementation is recommended, detailed roadmap is included

## Related Tasks

- Task #158: Implement session-aware versions of cursor built-in tools (original implementation)
- Task #249: Investigate and improve session-aware edit/reapply MCP tools with fast apply APIs

## Notes

This investigation was prompted by observations that the current patch-style diff approach, while functional, can sometimes have ambiguity issues in determining exact edit locations. The hypothesis is that a codemod-based approach might provide better precision and reliability, but this needs thorough investigation before any implementation effort.
