# Pull Request: Fix Minsky Session Delete Command Cleanup

## Overview
This PR fixes a critical issue in the `minsky session delete` command where it would sometimes report success but fail to remove the session record from the database.

The key improvements are:
- **Correct Repository Path Resolution**: The command now properly identifies repository locations using `SessionDB.getRepoPath()` instead of a hardcoded method, supporting both legacy and new directory structures with sessions subdirectory.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Added clear error propagation from the database layer to ensure failures are reported clearly rather than silently failing.
- **Improved Testing**: Enhanced existing tests and added new ones to verify correct behavior for path resolution and error handling.

## Commits
- 63aaaa41 Update CHANGELOG with minsky session delete command fix
- ba5c8458 Fix minsky session delete command to use correct repo path and properly handle DB record deletion failures
- 7b910627 WIP: Task 075 - Handoff point. Updated task spec. Code has known linter errors and test failures.

## Technical Details
1. The root cause of the issue was that the command used a local `getSessionRepoPath` function that only checked the legacy session repository location, not accounting for the newer "/sessions/" subdirectory structure.
2. When a session was using the new subdirectory structure, `fs.rm` with `force: true` wouldn't throw an error on a non-existent path, causing `repoDeleted` to be `true` even though no directory was actually deleted.
3. Additionally, error handling in the `SessionDB.deleteSession` method was improved to properly propagate errors to the caller.

## Testing
All tests are passing, including two new test cases specifically verifying:
1. Correct handling of sessions with a `repoPath` property
2. Proper error reporting when database record deletion fails

These tests verify that the fix properly addresses the issue described in task #075.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] The `minsky session delete` command successfully removes both the session repository directory and the session record from the database.
- [x] Appropriate error handling is in place for cases where cleanup fails.
- [x] Tests cover the corrected cleanup logic.
