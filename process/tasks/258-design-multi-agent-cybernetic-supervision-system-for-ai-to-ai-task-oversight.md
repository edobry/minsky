# Multi-Agent Cybernetic Supervision System

## Overview

Design and implement a multi-agent cybernetic supervision system that enables AI agents to supervise, intervene, and redirect other AI agents' work within the task graph execution framework. This system formalizes the human supervision patterns currently used in Cursor chat sessions and enables autonomous AI-to-AI supervision, creating a true cybernetic feedback loop for task execution.

## Vision

Transform the current human-supervised AI task execution model into a multi-agent system where:

- **Supervisor agents** monitor implementor agents' work in real-time
- **Intervention patterns** are formalized and automated
- **Task graph manipulation** can be performed by non-human agents
- **Cybernetic feedback loops** enable continuous system improvement
- **Human oversight** remains available but is no longer required for basic supervision

## Current State Analysis

### Human Supervision Patterns (to be automated)

1. **Real-time Intervention**: Human watches AI streaming responses and interrupts when:

   - AI is doing something wrong or suboptimal
   - Better direction becomes apparent
   - Approach needs to be redirected

2. **Task Graph Manipulation**: Human adds new tasks, iterates on requirements, and "pre-empts subgraphs" (needs better terminology)

3. **Quality Control**: Human notices and corrects:

   - Adherence to system guidelines
   - Detection of prohibited patterns (e.g., "linter error limit" mentions)
   - Ensuring best practices are followed

4. **Strategic Redirection**: Human provides higher-level guidance when AI gets stuck or goes off-track

## Requirements

### Core Capabilities

1. **Real-time Agent Monitoring**

   - Monitor implementor agent streaming responses
   - Detect problematic patterns or suboptimal approaches
   - Identify intervention opportunities
   - Track adherence to system guidelines

2. **Intervention System**

   - Interrupt implementor agent mid-execution
   - Provide corrective guidance
   - Redirect task execution approach
   - Inject new requirements or constraints

3. **Task Graph Manipulation**

   - Add new tasks dynamically
   - Modify existing task specifications
   - "Pre-empt subgraphs" (terminate and restart subtask branches)
   - Reorder task dependencies based on new information

4. **Pattern Recognition**

   - Detect prohibited language patterns (e.g., "linter error limit")
   - Identify suboptimal implementation approaches
   - Recognize when AI is stuck or going in circles
   - Spot opportunities for optimization

5. **Enhanced Rule System Integration**

   - **Live AT-INFERENCE Enforcement**: Upgrade existing rule system from prompt-time guidance to real-time enforcement
   - **Automated Rule Violation Detection**: Monitor for violations of existing rules (e.g., user-preferences, variable-naming-protocol)
   - **Runtime Rule Application**: Apply rules during execution, not just at prompt time
   - **Rule-Based Intervention Patterns**: Formalize interventions as executable rules with triggers and responses
   - **Dynamic Rule Creation**: Generate new rules based on successful intervention patterns

6. **Cybernetic Feedback**
   - Learn from intervention patterns

## Terminology Improvements Needed

Current terminology requires refinement for clarity and precision:

1. **"Pre-empting subgraphs"** → Proposed alternatives:

   - "Subgraph termination and restart"
   - "Branch pruning and redirection"
   - "Subtask invalidation and regeneration"
   - "Dependency chain interruption"

2. **"User requirements iteration"** → Proposed alternatives:

   - "Specification refinement cycles"
   - "Requirement evolution"
   - "Incremental specification development"

3. **"Intervention"** → May need more specific terms:
   - "Corrective guidance"
   - "Execution redirection"
   - "Quality enforcement"
   - "Strategic oversight"

## Implementation Approaches

**Detection**: Output analysis for scope boundary violations
**Intervention**: Redirect to original task specification
**Learning**: Refine scope boundary detection

### 4. Quality Standard Enforcement

**Problem**: Agent producing low-quality output
**Detection**: Quality metrics and pattern analysis
**Intervention**: Specific improvement guidance
**Learning**: Enhance quality detection algorithms

## Rule System Enhancement: From Prompt-Time to AT-INFERENCE Enforcement

### Current Rule System Analysis

The existing Minsky rule system (`.cursor/rules/`) operates primarily at **prompt-time**, providing guidance when rules are loaded. However, examination of current rules reveals sophisticated enforcement mechanisms that point toward **live AT-INFERENCE enforcement** capabilities:

**Current Enforcement Patterns:**

- **user-preferences.mdc**: Mandatory pre-response verification protocols
- **variable-naming-protocol.mdc**: Mandatory pre-change verification checklists
- **self-improvement.mdc**: Systematic error detection and correction frameworks

### Intervention-as-Rules Framework

**Key Insight**: Interventions like "There is no linter error limit, keep going" are essentially **executable rules** that can be derived from existing cursor rule files.

**Current Rule Enhancement Approach**: Rather than creating new rule formats, explore how existing `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files can be processed, embedded, and enhanced for real-time enforcement.

### Enhanced Rule System Architecture

**1. Existing Rule Processing Pipeline**

- **Rule Parsing**: Extract patterns, triggers, and enforcement mechanisms from current .mdc files
- **Rule Embedding**: Convert rule content into embeddings for pattern matching
- **Rule Processing**: Analyze existing enforcement language for AT-INFERENCE adaptation
- **Rule Enhancement**: Augment existing rules with runtime enforcement capabilities

**2. Runtime Rule Engine**
