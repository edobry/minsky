## Description

# Multi-Agent Cybernetic Supervision System

## Overview

Design and implement a multi-agent cybernetic supervision system that enables AI agents to supervise, intervene, and redirect other AI agents' work within the task graph execution framework. This system formalizes the human supervision patterns currently used in Cursor chat sessions and enables autonomous AI-to-AI supervision, creating a true cybernetic feedback loop for task execution.

## Vision

Transform the current human-supervised AI task execution model into a multi-agent system where:

- **Supervisor agents** monitor implementor agents' work in real-time
- **Intervention patterns** are formalized and automated
- **Task graph manipulation** can be performed by non-human agents
- **Cybernetic feedback loops** enable continuous system improvement
- **Human oversight** remains available but is no longer required for basic supervision

## Current State Analysis

### Human Supervision Patterns (to be automated)

1. **Real-time Intervention**: Human watches AI streaming responses and interrupts when:

   - AI is doing something wrong or suboptimal
   - Better direction becomes apparent
   - Approach needs to be redirected

2. **Task Graph Manipulation**: Human adds new tasks, iterates on requirements, and "pre-empts subgraphs" (needs better terminology)

3. **Quality Control**: Human notices and corrects:

   - Adherence to system guidelines
   - Detection of prohibited patterns (e.g., "linter error limit" mentions)
   - Ensuring best practices are followed

4. **Strategic Redirection**: Human provides higher-level guidance when AI gets stuck or goes off-track

## Requirements

### Core Capabilities

1. **Real-time Agent Monitoring**

   - Monitor implementor agent streaming responses
   - Detect problematic patterns or suboptimal approaches
   - Identify intervention opportunities
   - Track adherence to system guidelines

2. **Intervention System**

   - Interrupt implementor agent mid-execution
   - Provide corrective guidance
   - Redirect task execution approach
   - Inject new requirements or constraints

3. **Task Graph Manipulation**

   - Add new tasks dynamically
   - Modify existing task specifications
   - "Pre-empt subgraphs" (terminate and restart subtask branches)
   - Reorder task dependencies based on new information

4. **Pattern Recognition**

   - Detect prohibited language patterns (e.g., "linter error limit")
   - Identify suboptimal implementation approaches
   - Recognize when AI is stuck or going in circles
   - Spot opportunities for optimization

5. **Cybernetic Feedback**
   - Learn from intervention patterns
   - Improve supervision effectiveness over time
   - Adapt to new types of problems
   - Build knowledge base of successful interventions

### Technical Requirements

1. **Agent Communication Protocol**

   - Standardized messaging between supervisor and implementor agents
   - Interruption and resumption mechanisms
   - Context sharing and state synchronization
   - Priority and urgency handling

2. **Real-time Monitoring Infrastructure**

   - Stream processing of agent outputs
   - Pattern matching and anomaly detection
   - Performance metrics and quality indicators
   - Alerting and notification systems

3. **Intervention Mechanisms**

   - Graceful task interruption
   - Context preservation and restoration
   - Partial rollback capabilities
   - Alternative approach suggestion

4. **Learning and Adaptation**
   - Intervention outcome tracking
   - Pattern learning from successful interventions
   - Continuous improvement of supervision strategies
   - Knowledge base maintenance

## Terminology Improvements Needed

Current terminology requires refinement for clarity and precision:

1. **"Pre-empting subgraphs"** → Proposed alternatives:

   - "Subgraph termination and restart"
   - "Branch pruning and redirection"
   - "Subtask invalidation and regeneration"
   - "Dependency chain interruption"

2. **"User requirements iteration"** → Proposed alternatives:

   - "Specification refinement cycles"
   - "Requirement evolution"
   - "Incremental specification development"

3. **"Intervention"** → May need more specific terms:
   - "Corrective guidance"
   - "Execution redirection"
   - "Quality enforcement"
   - "Strategic oversight"

## Implementation Approaches

### 1. Supervisor Agent Architecture

### 2. Intervention Mechanisms

**Interruption Protocols**

- Context preservation and state capture
- Intervention message delivery
- Resumption or redirection

**Guidance Systems**

### 3. Task Graph Integration

**Dynamic Task Manipulation**

- Branch management and coordination

**State Management**

- Intervention history logging
- Context preservation across interruptions
- Rollback and recovery mechanisms

## Specific Intervention Examples

### 1. Linter Error Limit Detection

**Problem**: Implementor agent mentions "linter error limit" (prohibited by system guidelines)
**Detection**: Pattern matching in agent output stream
**Intervention**: Immediate interruption with message: "There is no linter error limit, keep going"
**Learning**: Build pattern database of similar guideline violations

### 2. Suboptimal Approach Detection

**Problem**: Agent repeatedly attempts failing approach
**Detection**: Retry pattern analysis and failure rate monitoring
**Intervention**: Suggest alternative approach or request human guidance
**Learning**: Improve approach recommendation algorithms

### 3. Scope Creep Prevention

**Problem**: Agent expanding beyond task specification
**Detection**: Output analysis for scope boundary violations
**Intervention**: Redirect to original task specification
**Learning**: Refine scope boundary detection

### 4. Quality Standard Enforcement

**Problem**: Agent producing low-quality output
**Detection**: Quality metrics and pattern analysis
**Intervention**: Specific improvement guidance
**Learning**: Enhance quality detection algorithms
