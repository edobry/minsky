# Evaluate zod-matter and Zod for Rule Metadata and Validation

## Context

Minsky's rule library system relies on robust metadata parsing and validation. The project currently uses gray-matter for frontmatter parsing and Zod for schema validation, but zod-matter may offer a more integrated, type-safe approach. This evaluation will determine the best tool for future development.

## Description

- Research the capabilities, tradeoffs, and best practices for using zod-matter (and Zod in general) for parsing and validating rule metadata in the Minsky rule library system.
- Compare zod-matter to gray-matter and other alternatives, focusing on:
  - Type safety
  - Validation ergonomics
  - Integration with existing Zod schemas
  - Frontmatter parsing and serialization
  - Error handling and developer experience
- Prototype a minimal loader using zod-matter with the current rule schema.
- Document findings, recommendations, and migration steps for the team.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A short write-up comparing zod-matter, gray-matter, and Zod for this use case.
- A working prototype (code sample) using zod-matter with the current rule schema.
- Clear recommendation for adoption (or not) and next steps.
