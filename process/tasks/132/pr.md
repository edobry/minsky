# feat(#132): Fix session get command output format

## Summary
This PR implements task #132, fixing the issue where `minsky session get --task <id>` only displayed `success: true` instead of showing comprehensive session details. The command now displays human-readable session information by default, while preserving the `--json` flag for machine-readable output.

## Motivation & Context
Users reported confusion when running `minsky session get --task 079` as it only showed `success: true` instead of the expected session details. This occurred because the CLI bridge's default output formatter was too simplistic - it only displayed primitive values from result objects, ignoring nested objects that contained the actual session data.

The root cause was in the `getDefaultFormatter` method in `src/adapters/shared/bridges/cli-bridge.ts`, which had basic object handling that missed complex nested structures. When commands returned `{ success: true, session: { ...details... } }`, only the `success` field was displayed.

## Design/Approach
Rather than modifying the core command logic or changing the `--json` flag behavior, we enhanced the CLI bridge's default formatter to intelligently handle different types of command results:

1. **Preserve existing functionality**: The `--json` flag continues to work exactly as before
2. **Add intelligent object formatting**: New logic detects session-related objects and formats them appropriately  
3. **Maintain backward compatibility**: All existing commands continue to work as expected
4. **Follow single responsibility principle**: Each new method handles a specific formatting concern

Alternative approaches considered:
- Modifying individual command outputs (rejected: would require changes across multiple command files)
- Creating a separate session formatter (rejected: would duplicate logic and complicate maintenance)
- Using a generic object display (rejected: would be verbose and hard to read for complex objects)

## Key Changes

### Enhanced CLI Bridge Formatter (`src/adapters/shared/bridges/cli-bridge.ts`)
- **Added `formatSessionDetails()` method**: Displays session information in a user-friendly format showing session name, task ID, repository details, branch, creation date, and backend type
- **Added `formatSessionSummary()` method**: Provides concise session information for list views
- **Enhanced `getDefaultFormatter()` method**: Added intelligent handling for:
  - Session objects: Detects and formats session data appropriately
  - Session directory results: Shows both success status and directory path
  - Session list results: Formats multiple sessions cleanly
  - Generic objects: Improved handling of nested objects vs. primitive values

### Before/After Examples

Before (only showing success):

    ❯ minsky session get --task 079
    success: true

After (comprehensive session details):

    ❯ minsky session get --task 079
    Session: task#079
    Task ID: #079
    Repository: local-minsky
    Session Path: /Users/edobry/.local/state/minsky/git/local-minsky/sessions/task#079
    Branch: task#079
    Created: 2025-05-16T22:16:33.321Z
    Backend: local

## Breaking Changes
None. All changes maintain complete backward compatibility:
- The `--json` flag continues to provide the same machine-readable output
- All existing commands work exactly as before
- No changes to command signatures or parameters

## Testing
- **Manual verification**: Tested `minsky session get --task 079` shows proper formatted output instead of just `success: true`
- **Created test script**: Verified the formatting functions work correctly with mock session data
- **Regression testing**: Confirmed `--json` flag still works and provides complete data
- **Session command testing**: Verified session list and session dir commands also benefit from improved formatting
- **Existing test suite**: All session-related tests continue to pass

### Test Coverage
- Unit testing for the new formatting methods would be beneficial (not included in this PR scope)
- Integration testing with actual session commands works as verified manually

## Screenshots/Examples

Example of the fixed output format:

<pre><code class="language-bash">
❯ minsky session get --task 079
Session: task#079
Task ID: #079  
Repository: local-minsky
Session Path: /Users/edobry/.local/state/minsky/git/local-minsky/sessions/task#079
Branch: task#079
Created: 2025-05-16T22:16:33.321Z
Backend: local
</code></pre>

JSON output remains unchanged:

<pre><code class="language-bash">
❯ minsky session get --task 079 --json
{
  "success": true,
  "session": {
    "session": "task#079",
    "taskId": "#079",
    "repoName": "local-minsky",
    "repoPath": "/Users/edobry/.local/state/minsky/git/local-minsky/sessions/task#079",
    "branch": "task#079", 
    "createdAt": "2025-05-16T22:16:33.321Z",
    "backendType": "local",
    "repoUrl": "/Users/edobry/Projects/minsky"
  }
}
</code></pre>

## Ancillary Changes
- **Fixed linting issues**: Updated code to use double quotes consistently and proper TypeScript typing
- **Added type safety**: Used proper TypeScript types for the new formatting methods
- **Improved error handling**: Added null checks and safe property access in formatting methods

## Implementation Notes
The solution extends the existing CLI bridge architecture rather than replacing it, ensuring minimal risk and maximum compatibility. The new formatting logic only activates for commands that return objects with session data, leaving all other command outputs unchanged.
