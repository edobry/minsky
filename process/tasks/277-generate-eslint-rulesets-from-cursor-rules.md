# Task 277: Generate ESLint Rulesets from Cursor Rules

## Status

- **Current Status**: OPEN
- **Assigned To**: Unassigned
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Created**: 2025-01-26
- **Updated**: 2025-01-26

## Description

Create a system to automatically generate ESLint rulesets from our existing cursor rules, with support for pre-computation and extensibility to other linting platforms. This will bridge the gap between our AI-driven cursor rules and traditional linting tools, enabling better code quality enforcement across different development environments.

## Context

Our `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files contain valuable patterns, conventions, and enforcement mechanisms that currently only benefit AI assistants. Many of these rules encode practices that could be automatically enforced through traditional linters like ESLint. By generating ESLint rulesets from cursor rules, we can:

1. **Extend rule coverage**: Make cursor rule patterns available to all developers, not just AI users
2. **Pre-compute enforcement**: Generate static linting rules that don't require AI inference
3. **Cross-platform support**: Enable rule enforcement in various editors and CI systems
4. **Consistency**: Ensure alignment between AI guidance and automated linting

## Requirements

### Phase 1: Cursor Rule Analysis and Extraction

1. **Rule Pattern Analysis**

   - Parse existing `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files for enforceable patterns
   - Extract specific coding conventions, naming patterns, and structural requirements
   - Identify rules that can be translated to static linting rules
   - Categorize rules by enforceability level (automatic, semi-automatic, manual)

2. **Pattern Recognition System**
   - Develop system to identify common enforcement patterns in cursor rules
   - Extract regex patterns, AST-based rules, and structural requirements
   - Create mapping between cursor rule language and ESLint rule concepts
   - Support for both explicit rules and inferred patterns

### Phase 2: ESLint Rule Generation

1. **Core Generation Engine**

   - Create system to generate ESLint rules from cursor rule patterns
   - Support for both built-in ESLint rules and custom rule generation
   - Generate rule configurations based on severity levels in cursor rules
   - Handle rule conflicts and precedence

2. **Custom Rule Creation**

   - Generate custom ESLint rules for patterns not covered by existing rules
   - Create AST-based rules for complex structural requirements
   - Support for autofix capabilities where possible
   - Integration with existing custom ESLint rule infrastructure

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Generate complete ESLint configuration files
   - Support for different rule sets (strict, recommended, minimal)
   - Environment-specific configurations (development, CI, production)
   - Integration with existing ESLint configuration

### Phase 3: Cross-Platform Support

1. **Platform Abstraction**

   - Create extensible architecture for multiple linting platforms
   - Support for other linters (TSLint, JSHint, StyleLint, etc.)
   - Plugin system for adding new platform support
   - Common rule representation format

2. **Platform-Specific Generators**
   - ESLint rule generator (primary focus)
   - Support for other TypeScript/JavaScript linters
   - Consider support for language-specific linters (Python, Go, etc.)
   - Output format adapters for different platforms

### Phase 4: Pre-computation and Optimization

1. **Build-Time Generation**

   - Generate rulesets during build process
   - Cache generated rules to avoid recomputation
   - Incremental generation based on rule changes
   - Integration with existing build pipeline

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize generated rules for performance
   - Minimize rule conflicts and redundancy
   - Support for rule prioritization and selective enforcement
   - Efficient rule loading and application

### Phase 5: Integration and Maintenance

1. **CLI Integration**

   - Add `minsky rules generate-eslint` command
   - Support for different output formats and configurations
   - Integration with existing `minsky rules` commands
   - Validation and testing of generated rules

2. **Maintenance and Updates**
   - Automatic regeneration when cursor rules change
   - Version tracking for generated rulesets
   - Backward compatibility considerations
   - Documentation for generated rules

## Implementation Details

### Rule Extraction Pipeline

```typescript
interface CursorRulePattern {
  name: string;
  pattern: string | RegExp | ASTPattern;
  severity: "error" | "warn" | "info";
  autofix?: boolean;
  description: string;
  examples: string[];
}

interface ESLintRuleMapping {
  cursorRule: string;
  eslintRule: string;
  configuration: object;
  customRule?: string;
}
```

### Generation Architecture

├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 1. Parse Cursor Rules → Extract Patterns → Map to ESLint       │

### Platform Support Strategy

1. **Start with ESLint**: Focus on comprehensive ESLint support first
2. **Extensible Architecture**: Design for easy addition of new platforms
3. **Common Patterns**: Identify patterns that translate across platforms
4. **Platform-Specific Optimizations**: Leverage unique features of each platform
