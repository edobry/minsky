# Add support for knowledge bases and documentation systems

## Context

Add support for 'knowledge bases'/'wikis'/'documentation systems'/etc, so that we can handle in-tree docs directories, Notion, github wiki, Confluence, etc. This could be useful to support the output of investigative work like the aforementioned, rather than just dumping it all in the task spec
