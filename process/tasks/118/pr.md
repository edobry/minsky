# fix(#118): Fix rule format errors in rules.ts

## Summary

Fixed issues with the rule format parsing in rules.ts that were causing "Rule not found" errors for several valid rules in the .cursor/rules directory.

## Changes

### Fixed

- Added try/catch blocks around matter parsing to handle YAML parsing errors in rule frontmatter
- Implemented graceful error handling for frontmatter parsing issues by extracting rule content even when frontmatter cannot be parsed correctly
- Added detailed debugging logs to aid in diagnosing rule parsing issues
- Fixed error handling in the `getRule` function to properly handle edge cases
- Resolved "Rule not found" errors for specific rules: no-dynamic-imports, designing-tests, rule-creation-guidelines, testing-router, bun-test-patterns, and framework-specific-tests
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with details of the fix
- Updated task status in process/tasks.md

## Testing

- Verified that all rules in the .cursor/rules directory are now properly recognized and loaded
- Confirmed that `minsky rules list` command no longer shows error messages for rule files
- Tested the solution with debug logging to verify correct handling of rule parsing
