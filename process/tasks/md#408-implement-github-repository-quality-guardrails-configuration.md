# md#408: Implement GitHub repository quality guardrails configuration

## Context

Add functionality to the GitHub repository backend to configure and enforce quality/safety constraints on GitHub repositories.

## Motivation

Just as we enforce code quality through linter rules on the development side, we should be able to enforce project quality and safety through repository-level guardrails. This ensures consistent standards across all repositories managed through Minsky, preventing common issues like:

- Unreviewed code reaching production
- Direct pushes to protected branches
- Missing required status checks
- Inconsistent branch protection policies

## High-Level Approach

Extend the GitHub repository backend with configuration management capabilities that can programmatically set up repository protection rules and quality gates. This would integrate with Minsky's existing configuration system to allow declarative specification of repository policies.

## Examples of Potential Guardrails

- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Protect main/production branches from direct pushes
- Require status checks to pass (CI/CD, linting, tests)
- Enforce linear history / require branches to be up to date
- Require signed commits
- Automatically delete head branches after merge
- Configure merge strategies (squash, rebase, merge commits)

## Implementation Considerations

- Leverage GitHub's Branch Protection API and Repository Settings API
- Integrate with Minsky's configuration system for declarative policy specification
- Provide both CLI commands and programmatic interfaces
- Support validation and dry-run modes
- Handle permission requirements and error scenarios gracefully

This mirrors our philosophy of 'configuration as code' and extends quality enforcement from the development environment to the repository level.
