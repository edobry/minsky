# Task #057: Implement TypeScript-based Rule Authoring System

## Context

The current Minsky rule system uses static `.mdc` files with YAML frontmatter. While this approach is simple and human-readable, it lacks the ability to dynamically generate content at build or installation time. A TypeScript-based rule authoring system would add powerful capabilities for dynamic content generation, programmatic transformations, and developer tooling while maintaining compatibility with the existing rule system.

## Requirements

1. **TypeScript Rule Format Design**

   - Design a TypeScript module format for rule authoring
   - Define interfaces and types for rule structure
   - Create a compilation pipeline from TS to MDC format
   - Support both static content and programmatically generated content

2. **Dynamic Content Generation**

   - Support capturing CLI help output at build time
   - Enable embedding command results in rule content
   - Allow rules to extract sections from the Cursor agent prompt
   - Provide utilities for dynamic content transformation

3. **Rule Authoring Tools**

   - Build CLI tools for TS rule creation and compilation
   - Create development workflows for TS-based rule authoring
   - Provide validation and error checking during compilation
   - Support debugging of rule generation logic

4. **Compatibility Layer**

   - Ensure compiled rules work with existing rule infrastructure
   - Maintain backward compatibility with MDC format
   - Support progressive migration of rules from MDC to TS
   - Allow mixed environments with both TS and MDC rules

5. **Developer Experience**
   - Provide clear documentation for TS rule authoring
   - Create templates for common rule types
   - Add testing utilities for rule generation logic
   - Support tooling like linting and formatting for rule code

## Implementation Steps

1. [ ] Design Phase:

   - [ ] Define TypeScript interfaces for rule structure
   - [ ] Establish compilation pipeline architecture
   - [ ] Document design decisions and rationale
   - [ ] Create prototypes for key features

2. [ ] Core Implementation:

   - [ ] Implement TypeScript rule loader/parser
   - [ ] Create MDC compilation functionality
   - [ ] Build dynamic content generation utilities
   - [ ] Implement validation and error reporting

3. [ ] CLI and Integration:

   - [ ] Extend `minsky rules` commands for TS rule support
   - [ ] Add compilation commands and options
   - [ ] Create rule authoring scaffolding tools
   - [ ] Integrate with existing rule management system

4. [ ] Testing and Documentation:

   - [ ] Create test suite for TS rule compilation
   - [ ] Write comprehensive documentation for rule authors
   - [ ] Add examples for common rule patterns
   - [ ] Document migration path from MDC to TS rules

5. [ ] Rule Migration:
   - [ ] Analyze existing rules for TS migration candidates
   - [ ] Create migration tools to assist conversion
   - [ ] Migrate selected rules as examples
   - [ ] Document best practices based on migration experience

## Verification

- [ ] TypeScript rules can be successfully authored and compiled to MDC
- [ ] Dynamic content generation works correctly for various use cases
- [ ] Compiled rules function identically to hand-written MDC rules
- [ ] Developer experience is smooth and well-documented
- [ ] Existing rule functionality is preserved during migration
- [ ] Testing confirms reliability of rule compilation

## Relation to Existing Components

- This task builds on the Rule Library System established in task #048
- It extends the rule authoring capabilities while maintaining compatibility
- The system would complement both Git-based and potential OCI-based distribution
- This provides a foundation for more sophisticated rule generation and templating
