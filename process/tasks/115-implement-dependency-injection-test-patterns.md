# Implement Dependency Injection Test Patterns

## Context

Our codebase has been gradually adopting Dependency Injection (DI) patterns to improve testability, as seen in recent tasks (#101: Improved Domain Module Testability, #103: Enhanced Test Utilities). However, we haven't fully leveraged these DI patterns in our test suite, which still heavily relies on mocking approaches that are incompatible with Bun's test runner.

As we migrate from Jest/Vitest patterns to Bun, we have an opportunity to fundamentally improve our test architecture by embracing dependency injection for testing, which will reduce our reliance on complex mocking and make tests more maintainable.

This task focuses on developing standardized patterns for testing with dependency injection in Bun, creating reusable test fixtures, and documenting these approaches for the team. It builds upon the foundation laid by the DI work in the application code but shifts the focus to how we leverage DI specifically for testing.

This task can run in parallel with the other testing infrastructure tasks but will provide valuable patterns that can be incorporated into the high-priority test migrations and the automated migration script.

## Requirements

1. **DI Test Pattern Development**

   - Develop standardized patterns for testing with dependency injection
   - Create approaches that minimize the need for complex mocking
   - Design patterns that work well with Bun's test runner
   - Ensure patterns maintain clear test intent and readability

2. **Reusable Test Fixture Framework**

   - Create a framework for building reusable test fixtures
   - Design fixtures that can be easily composed for different test scenarios
   - Include support for common scenarios like database access, file system, etc.
   - Ensure fixtures are compatible with parallel test execution

3. **Test Double Implementation**

   - Implement a library of test doubles (stubs, fakes, etc.) for common dependencies
   - Create test doubles that work with the DI system
   - Ensure test doubles have clean, consistent APIs
   - Make test doubles easily configurable for different test scenarios

4. **Integration with Existing DI Framework**

   - Ensure test patterns integrate with the existing DI framework
   - Create utilities for overriding dependencies in tests
   - Design patterns for partial application substitution
   - Support both global and local dependency overrides

5. **Test Lifecycle Management**
   - Develop patterns for setting up and tearing down test environments
   - Create utilities for managing test state between tests
   - Implement support for before/after hooks with DI context
   - Design patterns for test isolation with shared fixtures

## Implementation Steps

1. [ ] Analyze current DI implementation in the codebase:

   - [ ] Review the DI mechanisms currently in use
   - [ ] Identify integration points for testing
   - [ ] Evaluate current test patterns that use DI
   - [ ] Document strengths and weaknesses of current approaches

2. [ ] Design core DI test patterns:

   - [ ] Create patterns for constructor injection in tests
   - [ ] Design patterns for method injection
   - [ ] Develop patterns for property injection
   - [ ] Create patterns for module dependency overrides

3. [ ] Implement test fixture framework:

   - [ ] Design the core fixture interfaces
   - [ ] Implement base classes for common fixture types
   - [ ] Create composition mechanisms for fixtures
   - [ ] Add lifecycle management to fixtures

4. [ ] Develop test double library:

   - [ ] Implement base classes for different test double types
   - [ ] Create commonly needed test doubles for core services
   - [ ] Add configuration APIs for test scenarios
   - [ ] Ensure compatibility with the DI system

5. [ ] Create DI test utilities:

   - [ ] Develop utilities for dependency registration
   - [ ] Create helpers for dependency resolution
   - [ ] Implement scope management utilities
   - [ ] Add utilities for verifying DI configuration

6. [ ] Integrate with test lifecycle:

   - [ ] Create before/after hooks that work with DI
   - [ ] Implement test context initialization
   - [ ] Add support for shared test resources
   - [ ] Ensure proper cleanup after tests

7. [ ] Document the DI test patterns:

   - [ ] Create comprehensive guides with examples
   - [ ] Document best practices for different scenarios
   - [ ] Provide migration examples from mocking to DI
   - [ ] Include troubleshooting information

8. [ ] Create example tests using new patterns:
   - [ ] Implement examples for different test types
   - [ ] Create before/after comparisons with old patterns
   - [ ] Document performance and maintainability benefits
   - [ ] Provide examples for complex scenarios

## Verification

- [ ] Tests using DI patterns run successfully with Bun's test runner
- [ ] Test fixtures properly initialize and clean up resources
- [ ] Test doubles correctly simulate dependencies
- [ ] DI patterns integrate with the existing application DI framework
- [ ] Documentation clearly explains how to use the new patterns
- [ ] Example tests demonstrate improved readability and maintainability
- [ ] DI test patterns reduce the need for complex mocking

## Dependencies

- This task builds upon the DI work done in tasks #101 and #103
- The patterns developed in this task should be incorporated into the "Test Utility Documentation"
- Insights from this task should inform the "High-Priority Test Migration"
- The patterns should be considered for automation in the "Test Migration Script"
