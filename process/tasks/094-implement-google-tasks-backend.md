# Task #094: Implement Google Tasks Backend

## Context

The Minsky CLI currently supports task management through a default markdown backend (`tasks.md`) and has a placeholder for a GitHub backend. Adding support for Google Tasks would provide integration with Google's task management system, allowing users to interact with their Google Tasks directly from the Minsky CLI.

## Requirements

1. **Google Tasks Backend Implementation**

   - Implement a `GoogleTasksBackend` class that implements the `TaskBackend` interface
   - Support OAuth2 authentication with Google API
   - Store authentication tokens securely in the Minsky configuration directory
   - Handle token refresh and expiration

2. **Task Management Operations**

   - Implement the following operations for Google Tasks:
     - `listTasks`: List tasks from Google Tasks
     - `getTask`: Get a specific task by ID
     - `getTaskStatus`: Get the status of a task
     - `setTaskStatus`: Update the status of a task
     - `createTask`: Create a new task in Google Tasks
     - `getWorkspacePath`: Return the workspace path

3. **Mapping Between Systems**

   - Map Minsky task statuses (`TODO`, `IN-PROGRESS`, `IN-REVIEW`, `DONE`) to Google Tasks status
   - Map task IDs between systems
   - Handle synchronization of task metadata

4. **CLI Integration**

   - Update the TaskService to include the Google Tasks backend
   - Add the backend option to CLI commands
   - Update command schemas to include the new backend option

5. **Error Handling**

   - Implement robust error handling for API communication issues
   - Handle authentication failures gracefully
   - Provide clear error messages for configuration problems

6. **Documentation**
   - Document the setup process for Google Tasks integration
   - Add examples for using Google Tasks in the Minsky CLI
   - Update the README with information about the new backend

## Implementation Steps

1. [ ] Add Google API dependencies to the project

   - [ ] Add Google Tasks API client library
   - [ ] Add OAuth2 authentication libraries

2. [ ] Implement authentication flow

   - [ ] Create OAuth2 client setup
   - [ ] Implement token storage and retrieval
   - [ ] Handle token refresh and expiration

3. [ ] Create `GoogleTasksBackend` class

   - [ ] Implement `TaskBackend` interface methods
   - [ ] Add Google-specific functionality
   - [ ] Map between Google Tasks and Minsky data models

4. [ ] Update `TaskService` to include Google Tasks backend

   - [ ] Add Google Tasks to available backends
   - [ ] Update backend selection logic

5. [ ] Update CLI commands and schemas

   - [ ] Add 'google' as a backend option
   - [ ] Update command validation

6. [ ] Write tests

   - [ ] Unit tests for Google Tasks backend
   - [ ] Integration tests for backend operations
   - [ ] Mock API responses for testing

7. [ ] Add documentation
   - [ ] Setup instructions
   - [ ] Usage examples
   - [ ] README update

## Verification

- [ ] Google Tasks backend can be selected and used via CLI commands
- [ ] All TaskBackend methods work correctly with Google Tasks
- [ ] Authentication flow works properly
- [ ] Error handling is robust and user-friendly
- [ ] Documentation is clear and complete
- [ ] All tests pass
