## Overview

Remove the incompatible `@types/commander@2.12.5` package and systematically fix all TypeScript errors revealed by proper type checking. This will resolve 1235+ TypeScript errors across 97+ files that were previously hidden by the incompatible type definitions.

## Background

### What Happened

When we removed the outdated `@types/commander@2.12.5` package (incompatible with `commander@14.0.0`), TypeScript was finally able to perform proper analysis of the entire codebase. The incompatible types were causing TypeScript to fail early in analysis, masking 1235+ errors across 97+ files.

Commander 14.0.0 ships with built-in TypeScript definitions, so the separate `@types/commander` package is not needed and actually causes conflicts.

### Root Cause Analysis

The errors fall into several categories:

1. **Variable Naming Issues (60% of errors)**

   - Function parameters with underscores (`_options`, `_command`, `_data`) referenced without underscores in function bodies
   - This causes "Cannot find name 'X'" errors
   - Pattern: `function foo(_param) { return param; }` // param is undefined

2. **Bun Environment Compatibility (15% of errors)**

   - Direct `process.exit()` calls (Bun doesn't include this in type definitions)
   - `process.argv` usage (should use `Bun.argv`)
   - Node.js specific APIs that have different signatures in Bun

3. **Import/Export Issues (10% of errors)**

   - Missing type imports (`TaskData`, `TaskState`, etc.)
   - Incorrect import syntax for CommonJS modules (winston, gray-matter)
   - Module resolution issues

4. **Type Definition Gaps (10% of errors)**

   - Missing or incorrect type annotations
   - Variables typed as `unknown` when they should be specific types
   - Generic type parameter issues

5. **Test Infrastructure Issues (5% of errors)**
   - Mock/fixture utilities with type mismatches
   - Test-specific type issues that don't affect runtime

## Requirements

### Phase 1: Remove Incompatible Types Package

1. **Remove @types/commander package**

   ```bash
   bun remove @types/commander
   ```

2. **Verify Commander built-in types work**
   - Ensure Commander imports work correctly
   - Test basic CLI functionality

### Phase 2: Systematic Error Resolution

#### Category 1: Variable Naming Issues (Priority: HIGH)

**Scope**: ~740 errors across 58 files

**Pattern**: Parameters with underscores referenced without underscores

```typescript
// WRONG
function execute(_options: Options) {
  if (options.debug) {
    // ERROR: options is not defined
    // ...
  }
}

// CORRECT
function execute(options: Options) {
  if (options.debug) {
    // OK
    // ...
  }
}
```

**Files to fix** (highest priority):

- `src/domain/storage/json-file-storage.ts`
- `src/domain/tasks/jsonFileTaskBackend.ts`
- `src/utils/repository-utils.ts`
- `src/adapters/shared/commands/**/*.ts`
- `src/domain/configuration/**/*.ts`

**Implementation strategy**:

1. Create automated script to identify parameter/usage mismatches
2. Fix systematically file by file
3. Verify each fix doesn't break functionality
4. Use search-replace for common patterns

#### Category 2: Bun Environment Compatibility (Priority: HIGH)

**Scope**: ~185 errors across 13 files

**Issues**:

- `process.exit()` calls (should use custom `exit()` utility)
- `process.argv` usage (should use `Bun.argv`)
- Node.js specific APIs

**Files to fix**:

- All files identified in Task #165 (process.exit calls)
- Files using `process.argv`
- Files with Node.js specific imports

**Implementation strategy**:

1. Complete Task #165 first (process.exit replacement)
2. Replace `process.argv` with `Bun.argv`
3. Review Node.js specific API usage

#### Category 3: Import/Export Issues (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Scope**: ~123 errors across 12 files

**Issues**:

- Missing type imports
- Incorrect CommonJS import syntax
- Module resolution problems

**Files to fix**:

- `src/utils/logger.ts` (winston import)
- `src/domain/tasks/jsonFileTaskBackend.ts` (gray-matter import)
- Files missing TaskData, TaskState imports

**Implementation strategy**:

1. Add missing type imports
2. Fix CommonJS import syntax
3. Resolve module resolution issues

#### Category 4: Type Definition Gaps (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Scope**: ~123 errors across 8 files

**Issues**:

- Variables typed as `unknown`
- Missing type annotations
- Generic type parameter issues

**Implementation strategy**:

1. Add proper type annotations
2. Replace `unknown` with specific types
3. Fix generic type parameters

#### Category 5: Test Infrastructure Issues (Priority: LOW)

**Scope**: ~62 errors across 6 files

**Issues**:

- Mock/fixture type mismatches
- Test-specific type issues

**Implementation strategy**:

1. Fix after core functionality is working
2. May require test infrastructure updates

### Phase 3: Verification and Quality Assurance

1. **TypeScript Compilation**

   - Must compile without errors
   - Target: 0 TypeScript errors

2. **Functional Testing**

   - Core CLI commands must work
   - Key workflows must be preserved
   - No behavioral changes

3. **Test Suite**
   - Existing tests must pass
   - No regressions introduced

  - [ ] `minsky tasks list`
  - [ ] `minsky session start`
  - [ ] `minsky git pr`
  - [ ] `minsky config show`
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] No behavioral changes to existing functionality
- [x] Improved type safety throughout codebase ‚úÖ SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS (315+ variable naming fixes, property corrections)

## Technical Analysis

### Why These Errors Were Hidden

1. **Type Checking Cascade Failure**: The incompatible `@types/commander` caused TypeScript to fail early in analysis
2. **Dependency Resolution Issues**: Conflicting type definitions prevented proper module resolution
3. **Incomplete Analysis**: TypeScript stopped checking many files when it encountered the Commander type conflicts

### Why These Are Real Errors

1. **Runtime Impact**: Variable naming issues cause actual runtime errors (like the original `_options is not defined`)
2. **Type Safety**: Missing type annotations reduce IDE support and catch fewer bugs
3. **Environment Compatibility**: Bun-specific issues prevent proper execution in the Bun runtime

### Recommended Approach

1. **Automated Where Possible**: Use scripts for repetitive patterns (variable naming)
2. **Manual Review for Complex Cases**: Import issues and type definitions need careful review
3. **Incremental Verification**: Test functionality after each category of fixes
4. **Parallel Work**: Some categories can be worked on simultaneously

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**:

- Variable naming fixes (mechanical changes)
- Process.exit replacements (already have working utility)

**Medium Risk**:

- Import/export changes (could affect module loading)
- Type definition changes (could reveal new issues)

**High Risk**:

- None identified - all changes are type-level improvements

## Dependencies

- Must complete Task #165 (process.exit replacement) first
- Requires comprehensive testing infrastructure
- May need to update development tools/scripts

## Estimated Effort

**Large** - 1235+ errors across 97+ files, but many are mechanical fixes that can be automated or batch-processed. The systematic approach will make this manageable over 2-3 weeks.
