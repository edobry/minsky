# Update fastmcp Dependency to v3.3.0

## Context

Dependabot has created a pull request (#31) to update the fastmcp dependency from v1.27.7 to v3.3.0. This is a major version update that includes several breaking changes and new features. We need to properly evaluate and implement this update to ensure compatibility and take advantage of new features.

## Requirements

1. **Evaluate Breaking Changes**

   - Review the changelog for breaking changes between v1.27.7 and v3.3.0
   - Identify any API changes that require code updates
   - Document all breaking changes that affect our codebase

2. **Test Compatibility**

   - Create a test branch with the updated dependency
   - Run the full test suite to identify any compatibility issues
   - Test MCP server functionality with the new version
   - Verify CLI and MCP adapter compatibility

3. **Implement Required Changes**

   - Update code to handle any breaking changes
   - Migrate to new APIs where beneficial
   - Update any deprecated usage patterns
   - Ensure proper error handling for new error types

4. **Documentation Updates**

   - Update any relevant documentation
   - Document new features and capabilities
   - Update any examples or usage patterns

5. **Performance and Security**
   - Evaluate performance impact of the update
   - Review security implications
   - Test memory usage and resource consumption

## Implementation Steps

   - [x] Update HTTP server endpoint configuration
   - [x] Remove SSE transport support (deprecated in v3.x)
   - [x] Update CLI tooling integration
4. [x] Test MCP server functionality:
   - [x] Verify server startup and shutdown
   - [x] Test client connections
   - [x] Verify message handling and tool registration
   - [x] Test error handling
5. [ ] Update documentation and examples
6. [ ] Create PR with changes and test results

## Current Progress

### âœ… Completed Work
