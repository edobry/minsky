## Research Methodology

### 1. System Survey Approach

#### Target Systems for Analysis
- **Policy Systems**: OPA/Rego, AWS IAM, Kubernetes, XACML, Cedar
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, TypeScript, SonarQube, custom linting
- **Hybrid Systems**: TypeScript-based rules, cybernetics, policy-as-code

#### Analysis Dimensions
1. **Temporal Scope**: When policies/rules are enforced
2. **Domain Specificity**: How general vs specialized the system is
3. **Enforcement Mechanisms**: Advisory vs blocking vs transformative
4. **Composability**: How rules combine and interact
5. **Expressiveness**: What constraints can be expressed

### 2. Theoretical Framework Development

#### Core Questions
1. Are rules and policies the same concept?
2. What are the fundamental differences if any?
3. How do different communities define these terms?

#### Approach
- Formal definition analysis
- Cross-domain terminology mapping
- Conceptual boundary identification
- Philosophical examination

### 3. Cybernetics Integration

#### Control Theory Applications
- Rules as feedback mechanisms
- Homeostatic system regulation
- Adaptive control systems
- Multi-level feedback loops

#### Inference-time Enforcement
- AI system governance patterns
- Dynamic constraint adaptation
- Learning from rule violations
- Emergent behavior management
