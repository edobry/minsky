# Multi-Agent Collaborative Messaging Architecture

## Overview

Extend the current notion of "user interventions/prompts" to a comprehensive **multi-agent messaging system** that enables both human users and AI agents to collaboratively iterate on artifacts through structured message exchanges across diverse contexts. This system will serve as the communication backbone for the multi-agent architecture envisioned in related tasks while supporting persistent conversation history and rolling summaries.

## Vision: From User Interventions to Multi-Agent Collaboration

Transform the current human-centric intervention model into a **universal messaging platform** where:

- **Multi-agent participation**: Both human users and AI agents can send and receive messages
- **Context-aware messaging**: Messages adapt to different collaborative contexts (tasks, PRs, chat sessions, reviews)
- **Persistent conversation streams**: Maintain threaded conversation history with intelligent summarization
- **Artifact-centric collaboration**: Enable iterative collaboration on specific artifacts (tasks, PRs, sessions, code)
- **Cross-context continuity**: Preserve conversation context across different interaction modes

## Related Task Integration

This task builds upon and integrates with several key architectural initiatives:

### Task #258: Multi-Agent Cybernetic Supervision System
- **Integration Point**: Messages serve as the communication medium for monitor agents to intervene with implementor agents
- **Alignment**: Chain-of-Thought monitoring interventions become structured messages in the conversation stream
- **Enhancement**: Real-time intervention patterns are captured as message threads for learning and improvement

### Task #279: Multi-Layered Agent Memory System
- **Integration Point**: Messages feed into the memory system's conversation history and rolling summaries
- **Alignment**: Working memory maintains message context within sessions, medium-term memory retains conversation patterns
- **Enhancement**: Message content contributes to knowledge accumulation across temporal scales

### Task #260/#284: Prompt Templates and Analytics
- **Integration Point**: Messages can be generated from templates and contribute to pattern discovery
- **Alignment**: Common message patterns become candidates for template creation
- **Enhancement**: Message analytics inform template suggestions and variable substitution patterns

### Session and Task Architecture
- **Integration Point**: Messages are contextualized within specific tasks and sessions
- **Alignment**: Task-first workflow includes message threads as part of task documentation
- **Enhancement**: Session approval workflows include conversation history for context

## Current State Analysis

### Existing "User Intervention" Patterns

**1. Real-time Human Supervision** (to be extended to AI agents):
- Manual interruption when AI approaches are suboptimal
- Strategic redirection during task execution
- Quality control and guideline enforcement
- **Target**: Enable AI monitor agents to send intervention messages

**2. Task Graph Manipulation** (to be structured as messages):
- Adding new tasks based on discoveries
- Requirement iteration and refinement
- Subgraph preemption and restart decisions
- **Target**: Capture decision rationale in message threads

**3. Current Prompt/Response Model** (to be evolved):
- Single-shot prompts with isolated responses
- Limited context preservation across interactions
- Manual typing of similar prompt patterns
- **Target**: Persistent conversation streams with context continuity

### Limitations of Current Approach

- **Single-direction communication**: Only humans can initiate prompts
- **Context isolation**: No conversation memory between interactions
- **Inflexible structure**: Prompts are unstructured text without metadata
- **Limited artifact association**: No clear linkage to specific work items
- **No collaboration patterns**: No support for multi-participant conversations

## Architecture Requirements

### 1. Multi-Agent Message Framework

**Message Structure**:
```typescript
interface Message {
  id: string;
  threadId: string;
  context: MessageContext;
  sender: AgentIdentity;
  content: MessageContent;
  metadata: MessageMetadata;
  timestamp: string;
  parentMessageId?: string;
}

interface AgentIdentity {
  type: 'human' | 'ai';
  id: string;
  role?: 'implementor' | 'monitor' | 'reviewer' | 'user';
  capabilities?: string[];
}

interface MessageContext {
  type: 'task' | 'session' | 'pr' | 'issue' | 'chat' | 'review';
  artifactId: string;
  workspaceId?: string;
  repositoryId?: string;
}
```

**Agent Participation Patterns**:
