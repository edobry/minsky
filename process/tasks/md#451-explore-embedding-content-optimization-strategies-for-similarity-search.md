# Explore embedding content optimization strategies for similarity search

## Context

Currently our task similarity search uses simple title + full spec content for embeddings. There are several potential optimizations worth exploring to improve semantic search quality and performance.

## Research Questions

1. **Content Structure Impact**: Does adding structured sections (summary, key terms) improve search relevance?
2. **Redundancy vs Emphasis**: Does repeating key concepts in summary form help or hurt embedding quality?
3. **Length Optimization**: What's the optimal content length for embedding generation?
4. **Domain Adaptation**: Do different content strategies work better for different types of tasks?

## Proposed Experiments

### Experiment 1: Content Structure Variations

Test different embedding content formats:

- A: Title + Full Spec (current)
- B: Title + Summary + Full Spec
- C: Title + Key Terms + Full Spec
- D: Title + Summary + Key Terms + Full Spec
- E: Summary Only (for comparison)

### Experiment 2: Length Analysis

- Measure embedding quality vs content length
- Test truncation strategies (first N chars, summary-only, etc.)
- Analyze token usage and cost implications

### Experiment 3: Search Quality Metrics

- Create test dataset of tasks with known similarity relationships
- Measure precision/recall for different content strategies
- Test with various query types (keyword, natural language, task descriptions)

## Implementation Approach

1. **Create embedding variants**: Generate embeddings for same tasks using different content strategies
2. **Benchmark search quality**: Use existing task corpus to measure search relevance
3. **Performance analysis**: Compare embedding generation time and vector storage costs
4. **A/B testing framework**: Set up configurable content extraction for live testing

## Success Criteria

- Quantitative comparison of search quality across content strategies
- Performance benchmarks for embedding generation and storage
- Recommendation for optimal content strategy based on data
- Implementation plan for chosen approach

## Timeline

- Phase 1: Experiment framework and baseline measurements (1-2 days)
- Phase 2: Content strategy experiments and data collection (2-3 days)
- Phase 3: Analysis and recommendations (1 day)

## Dependencies

- Current task similarity service (md#439)
- Task corpus for testing
- Embedding service infrastructure

## Notes

This research will inform both the current task similarity system and the future generic similarity service (md#447). The findings should be applicable across domains (tasks, rules, etc.).
