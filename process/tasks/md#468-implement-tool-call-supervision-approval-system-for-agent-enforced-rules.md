# Implement Tool Call Supervision/Approval System for Agent-Enforced Rules

## Task ID
md#468

## Status

TODO

## Priority

HIGH

## Category

ARCHITECTURE / SECURITY

## Context

Building on the multi-agent cybernetic supervision framework (Task #258) and the "seek human input" patterns (Task #454), we need a system that enables AI agents to review, approve, or reject tool calls from other AI agents before execution. This implements a critical layer of automated rule enforcement that goes beyond prompt-time guidance to real-time execution control.

**Core Use Case**: Prevent agents from using prohibited command patterns like `git commit --no-verify` which bypasses pre-commit hooks, ensuring that certain safety mechanisms can never be circumvented.

Related theoretical work:

- Task #291 explores the overlap between rules systems and policy DSLs
- Task #326 addresses generating ESLint rulesets from cursor rules
- Task #258 designs multi-agent cybernetic supervision systems
- Task #454 investigates human input tools and agent inbox patterns

## Objectives

1. **Tool Call Interception Layer**: Create a system that can intercept and review tool calls before execution
2. **Rule-Based Policy Engine**: Implement configurable rules that can approve, reject, or modify tool calls
3. **Agent Supervisor Framework**: Enable AI agents to act as supervisors for other agents' tool calls
4. **Human Escalation Path**: Seamless handoff to human approval when agent supervision is insufficient
5. **Audit and Transparency**: Complete logging and reasoning transparency for all supervision decisions

## Vision

Transform tool call execution from direct invocation to a supervised, policy-enforced system where:

- **Pre-execution Review**: All tool calls pass through a supervision layer before execution
- **Automated Rule Enforcement**: Common patterns (like `--no-verify` bans) are automatically blocked
- **Agent-Level Supervision**: AI supervisors can make complex decisions about tool call appropriateness
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to human approval when agent supervision is uncertain
- **Learning and Adaptation**: Supervision patterns improve over time based on outcomes

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Tool Call Interception Pipeline

```
AI Agent → Tool Call → Supervision Layer → Policy Engine → Execution
                           ↓
                    Agent Supervisor ← Rules Database
                           ↓
                   [Approve/Reject/Modify/Escalate]
                           ↓
              Human Escalation (if needed) → Resolution
```

## Detailed Requirements

### 1. Tool Call Interception and Routing

**Interception Capabilities**

- [ ] Capture complete tool call context (command, args, working directory, agent identity)
- [ ] Support for both synchronous and asynchronous tool calls
- [ ] Graceful handling of interception failures

**Routing Logic**

- [ ] Policy-based routing to different supervision mechanisms

### 2. Rule-Based Policy Engine

**Core Rule Types**

1. **Prohibition Rules** (immediate rejection)

   ```
   BLOCK: git commit --no-verify
   BLOCK: rm -rf /
   BLOCK: sudo commands (unless explicitly allowed)
   BLOCK: commands that modify production systems
   ```

2. **Requirement Rules** (enforce patterns)

   ```
   REQUIRE: git commits must include task reference
   REQUIRE: file modifications must include backup creation
   REQUIRE: API calls must include rate limiting headers
   ```

3. **Modification Rules** (transform commands)

   ```
   TRANSFORM: git commit --no-verify → git commit
   TRANSFORM: npm install → npm install --save-exact
   TRANSFORM: dangerous commands → safer alternatives
   ```

4. **Escalation Rules** (require human approval)
   ```
   ESCALATE: commands affecting production data
   ESCALATE: multi-file refactoring operations
   ESCALATE: commands outside of session workspace
