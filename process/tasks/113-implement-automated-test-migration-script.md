# Task #113: Implement Automated Test Migration Script

## Context

Our test suite is experiencing significant issues when running under Bun's test runner, with 114 failing tests primarily due to incompatibilities between Jest/Vitest mocking patterns and Bun's test API. While the "Core Mock Compatibility Layer" task will address immediate compatibility needs, we still need to migrate tests to use native Bun patterns for long-term maintainability.

Manually migrating hundreds of tests would be time-consuming and error-prone. Instead, we need an automated approach that can analyze test files, identify patterns needing migration, and perform the necessary transformations.

This task depends on insights from the "Test Inventory and Classification" task to understand the patterns to target, and it will work alongside the "Core Mock Compatibility Layer" to ensure a smooth transition.

## Requirements

1. **AST-Based Test Analyzer**

   - Create a tool that can parse and analyze test files using an AST
   - Identify Jest/Vitest-specific patterns including:
     - Import statements for Jest/Vitest
     - Mock function creation and usage
     - Assertion patterns
     - Module mocking
   - Generate a structured representation of required changes

2. **Pattern Transformation Rules**

   - Develop transformation rules for common patterns:
     - Convert `jest.fn()` to compatibility layer or native Bun equivalents
     - Transform module mocks to use Bun's approach
     - Update assertion patterns to be compatible with Bun
     - Replace Jest/Vitest-specific utilities with Bun equivalents

3. **Interactive Migration Tool**

   - Create a command-line tool that can:
     - Analyze test files for migration opportunities
     - Preview changes before applying them
     - Apply transformations to test files
     - Report on the changes made
     - Track migration progress

4. **Migration Verification**

   - Include functionality to verify tests after migration:
     - Run tests before and after migration
     - Compare test results
     - Flag tests that may need manual attention
     - Generate reports on migration success rates

5. **Batch Processing Support**
   - Support batch processing of multiple test files
   - Allow selective migration based on patterns or directories
   - Support rollback of changes if tests fail after migration
   - Track overall migration progress across the codebase
