# Task #113: Implement Automated Test Migration Script

## Context

Our test suite is experiencing significant issues when running under Bun's test runner, with 114 failing tests primarily due to incompatibilities between Jest/Vitest mocking patterns and Bun's test API. While the "Core Mock Compatibility Layer" task will address immediate compatibility needs, we still need to migrate tests to use native Bun patterns for long-term maintainability.

Manually migrating hundreds of tests would be time-consuming and error-prone. Instead, we need an automated approach that can analyze test files, identify patterns needing migration, and perform the necessary transformations.

This task depends on insights from the "Test Inventory and Classification" task to understand the patterns to target, and it will work alongside the "Core Mock Compatibility Layer" to ensure a smooth transition.

## Requirements

1. **AST-Based Test Analyzer**

   - Create a tool that can parse and analyze test files using an AST
   - Identify Jest/Vitest-specific patterns including:
     - Import statements for Jest/Vitest
     - Mock function creation and usage
     - Assertion patterns
     - Module mocking
   - Generate a structured representation of required changes

2. **Pattern Transformation Rules**

   - Develop transformation rules for common patterns:
     - Convert `jest.fn()` to compatibility layer or native Bun equivalents
     - Transform module mocks to use Bun's approach
     - Update assertion patterns to be compatible with Bun
     - Replace Jest/Vitest-specific utilities with Bun equivalents

3. **Interactive Migration Tool**

   - Create a command-line tool that can:
     - Analyze test files for migration opportunities
     - Preview changes before applying them
     - Apply transformations to test files
     - Report on the changes made
     - Track migration progress

4. **Migration Verification**

   - Include functionality to verify tests after migration:
     - Run tests before and after migration
     - Compare test results
     - Flag tests that may need manual attention
     - Generate reports on migration success rates

5. **Batch Processing Support**
   - Support batch processing of multiple test files
   - Allow selective migration based on patterns or directories
   - Support rollback of changes if tests fail after migration
   - Track overall migration progress across the codebase

## Implementation Steps

1. [ ] Design the AST analyzer:

   - [ ] Select an appropriate AST parser for TypeScript/JavaScript
   - [ ] Define pattern recognition rules for Jest/Vitest patterns
   - [ ] Create an analyzer that can identify migration targets
   - [ ] Test the analyzer on sample test files

2. [ ] Implement transformation rules:

   - [ ] Create rules for converting mock functions
   - [ ] Create rules for transforming module mocks
   - [ ] Create rules for updating assertion patterns
   - [ ] Create rules for replacing utility functions

3. [ ] Build the code transformation engine:

   - [ ] Implement AST transformation logic
   - [ ] Add code generation capabilities
   - [ ] Ensure formatting is preserved during transformation
   - [ ] Add validation to check that transformations are correct

4. [ ] Create the command-line interface:

   - [ ] Implement commands for analyzing files
   - [ ] Add commands for previewing transformations
   - [ ] Create commands for applying transformations
   - [ ] Add reporting functionality

5. [ ] Implement verification features:

   - [ ] Add test execution before and after migration
   - [ ] Implement result comparison logic
   - [ ] Create detailed reports on test outcomes
   - [ ] Add functionality to flag problematic migrations

6. [ ] Add batch processing capabilities:

   - [ ] Support processing multiple files
   - [ ] Implement directory-based processing
   - [ ] Add tracking for overall progress
   - [ ] Implement rollback capability for failed migrations

7. [ ] Create documentation and examples:
   - [ ] Document the tool's commands and options
   - [ ] Provide examples of common migration scenarios
   - [ ] Include troubleshooting guidance
   - [ ] Add integration guidelines with the migration workflow

## Verification

- [ ] The tool successfully identifies Jest/Vitest patterns in test files
- [ ] Transformations correctly convert patterns to Bun equivalents
- [ ] Tests pass after automated migration
- [ ] The tool provides clear reports on migration progress and issues
- [ ] Batch processing effectively handles multiple files
- [ ] The command-line interface is intuitive and provides helpful feedback
- [ ] Documentation covers all tool functionality and common scenarios

## Dependencies

- This task depends on insights from the "Test Inventory and Classification" task to understand patterns to target
- This task should be aligned with the "Core Mock Compatibility Layer" to ensure consistent approach
- The "Test Utility Documentation" task should be updated to include guidance on using this migration tool
