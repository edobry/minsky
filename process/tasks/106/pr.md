# refactor(#106): Refactor SessionDB to Functional Patterns

## Summary

This PR implements a comprehensive refactoring of the SessionDB module to follow functional programming patterns as part of task #106 (subtask of #102). The new implementation separates pure functions from side effects, improves testability, and maintains backward compatibility through an adapter class.

## Changes

### Added

- Created a pure functions module (`session-db.ts`) that contains all business logic with no side effects
- Created an I/O operations module (`session-db-io.ts`) to isolate file system interactions
- Implemented an adapter class (`session-adapter.ts`) that provides backward compatibility
- Added comprehensive tests for both pure functions and the adapter class
- Implemented a factory function for creating session providers
- Added proper exports for the new functional implementation

### Changed

- Updated the domain index file to export both legacy and functional implementations
- Modified createSessionProvider to use the new implementation
- Updated the CHANGELOG.md to document the changes

### Fixed

- Fixed a critical bug with session directory creation and path normalization
- Improved error handling for repoPath resolution
- Added proper type definitions and interfaces
- Enhanced session repository path detection with multiple fallback strategies

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with both unit tests and manual verification:
- Added dedicated test files for both pure functions and the adapter class
- Verified that session creation works correctly by creating test sessions
- Confirmed directory creation and proper path normalization

## Checklist

- [x] All requirements implemented
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] Code quality is acceptable
- [x] Documentation is updated
- [x] Changelog is updated
