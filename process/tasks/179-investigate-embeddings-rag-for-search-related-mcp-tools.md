# Investigate Embeddings/RAG for Search-Related MCP Tools

## Context

Our current MCP tools provide search functionality (`codebase_search`, `grep_search`, `file_search`) that relies on basic text matching and simple semantic search. As the codebase grows and becomes more complex, we need to investigate advanced search techniques like embeddings and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve search relevance, context understanding, and code discovery capabilities.

This investigation should explore how embeddings/RAG technologies can enhance our search-related MCP tools and provide AI agents with more intelligent code exploration capabilities.

## Objective

Conduct comprehensive research into embeddings/RAG technologies for code search and determine how to integrate these techniques into our MCP tool ecosystem to improve search quality, context understanding, and developer productivity.

## Research Areas

### 1. Foundational Understanding

**Embeddings Technology:**

- How do text/code embeddings work fundamentally?
- What are the different types of embeddings (word, sentence, code, semantic)?
- How do embeddings capture semantic meaning vs. syntactic structure?
- What are the computational requirements and performance characteristics?

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):**

- How does RAG work conceptually and technically?
- What are the key components: embedding store, retrieval mechanism, generation pipeline?
- How does RAG differ from simple semantic search?
- What are the advantages over traditional search approaches?

### 2. Code-Specific Applications

**Code Embeddings:**

- How do code embeddings differ from natural language embeddings?
- What code-specific models exist (CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, CodeT5, etc.)?
- How do they handle different programming languages and paradigms?
- What granularity levels work best (token, line, function, file, project)?

**Code Search Use Cases:**

- Semantic code search (find functionality by description)
- Similar code detection (find patterns and duplicates)
- Cross-language code search and translation
- Documentation-to-code mapping
- API usage pattern discovery

### 3. Best Practices and Patterns

**Architecture Patterns:**

- How to structure embedding-based search systems?
- What are common data pipelines for code indexing?
- How to handle incremental updates and cache invalidation?
- What are scaling patterns for large codebases?

**Performance Considerations:**

- Embedding generation: batch vs. real-time
- Vector database selection and optimization
- Query optimization and caching strategies
- Memory usage and storage requirements

**Quality and Accuracy:**

- How to evaluate search quality and relevance?
- What metrics matter for code search (precision, recall, ranking)?
- How to handle edge cases and domain-specific code?
- User feedback integration and model improvement

### 4. Technology Stack Investigation

**Embedding Models:**
