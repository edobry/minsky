# Task #060: Implement Automatic Test Linting

## Context
To enforce consistent test practices and catch common errors early, we need to implement custom ESLint rules specifically for our test files. This will help ensure adherence to the patterns documented in our testing rules.

## Requirements
- Create custom ESLint rules to enforce bun:test patterns (e.g., correct mock function creation, mock cleanup).
- Configure ESLint to apply these rules to test files (`.test.ts`, `.spec.ts`).
- Ensure rules provide clear error messages.
- Consider adding exceptions or configurations for known type/linter discrepancies where appropriate (e.g., allowing `@ts-ignore` with descriptions for specific cases).

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Identify key patterns from `bun-test-patterns.mdc` to enforce.
- [ ] Create custom ESLint plugin or add rules directly in `.eslintrc.json`.
- [ ] Implement rule to check for correct mock function usage (`jest.fn()`).
- [ ] Implement rule to check for mock cleanup (`mock.restore()`).
- [ ] Implement rule to check for correct imports.
- [ ] Configure ESLint to apply new rules to test files.
- [ ] Test rules against existing codebase to identify violations.
- [ ] Refactor existing code to comply with new rules.
- [ ] Update documentation.

## Verification
- [ ] Running `bun lint` catches violations of the new rules.
- [ ] The codebase adheres to the new linting rules.
- [ ] The rules do not produce excessive false positives.
