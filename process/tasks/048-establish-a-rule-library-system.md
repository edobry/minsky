# Task #048: Establish a Rule Library System

## Context

Minsky currently installs a fixed set of rules when initializing projects with `minsky init`. As the Minsky ecosystem grows, the rules become more numerous and diverse, requiring a more flexible system for managing, versioning, and distributing these rules. A dedicated rule library system would allow projects to select and install rules that are relevant to their specific stack and priorities, while also enabling easier contribution, versioning, and updates to rules.

## Requirements

1. **Research & Design**

   - Investigate and document approaches to rule library management
   - Determine optimal repository structure (standalone vs. part of Minsky core)
   - Research versioning schemes for rules and rule sets
   - Define a protocol for rule discovery, validation, and installation
   - Design an extensible metadata format for rules using zod-matter
   - Consider integration with existing `minsky rules` subcommands

2. **Rule Organization & Categorization**

   - Design a categorical structure for organizing rules (e.g., by domain, language, toolset)
   - Create a system of tags or attributes for rule discovery
   - Design a mechanism for defining rule dependencies and conflicts
   - Support bundling commonly used rules into "rule sets" for specific technologies or workflows

3. **Installation & Update Mechanisms**

   - Enhance `minsky init` to install a customizable subset of rules
   - Design rule update mechanisms to maintain rules in existing projects
   - Support checking for rule updates and conflicts
   - Establish a method for progressive rule adoption in existing projects

4. **Contribution System**

   - Design a contribution framework for rule authors
   - Define validation standards and quality checks for contributed rules
   - Create templates and guidelines for rule creation
   - Support for community rules alongside official rules

5. **Versioning & Compatibility**

   - Create a versioning scheme for individual rules
   - Design a mechanism for tracking rule compatibility with Minsky versions
   - Support pinning rule versions to ensure stability
   - Allow for deprecation and replacement of rules

6. **Rule Generation**
   - Implement support for programmatic rule generation
   - Leverage zod-matter for schema validation and YAML frontmatter generation
   - Create utilities for generating rule boilerplate
   - Support template substitution for rule content

## Implementation Steps

1. [ ] Research Phase:

   - [ ] Document existing rule structures and metadata
   - [ ] Investigate repository approaches (mono-repo, separate repo, etc.)
   - [ ] Survey analogous systems in other tools for inspiration
   - [ ] Create a design document outlining the chosen approach

2. [ ] Core Architecture:

   - [ ] Define rule library repository structure
   - [ ] Design rule metadata schema with zod-matter
   - [ ] Implement rule validation utilities
   - [ ] Create rule categorization system

3. [ ] Integration with Minsky:

   - [ ] Extend `minsky init` to support rule library integration
   - [ ] Add rule discovery and installation functionality
   - [ ] Implement rule update commands
   - [ ] Design compatibility checking system

4. [ ] Rule Management System:

   - [ ] Create CLI commands for rule installation, update, and removal
   - [ ] Implement rule dependency resolution
   - [ ] Add support for rule sets (collections of related rules)
   - [ ] Create interfaces for rule management

5. [ ] Rule Generation Utilities:

   - [ ] Implement programmatic rule creation tools
   - [ ] Create templates for common rule types
   - [ ] Build frontmatter generation tools with zod-matter
   - [ ] Design rule testing and validation framework

6. [ ] Documentation and Examples:
   - [ ] Comprehensive documentation for rule library usage
   - [ ] Examples of rule creation and contribution
   - [ ] Guidelines for rule design and best practices
   - [ ] Sample rule sets for common technologies

## Verification

- [ ] The rule library system correctly organizes rules by category, domain, and purpose
- [ ] The `minsky init` command can install a customizable subset of rules
- [ ] Rule metadata is validated using zod-matter
- [ ] Rules can be versioned, updated, and managed
- [ ] Rules can depend on other rules and detect conflicts
- [ ] Rule sets can be defined and installed as units
- [ ] Rule generation utilities create valid rule files
- [ ] The system is compatible with existing `minsky rules` commands
- [ ] Documentation is comprehensive and clear

## Relation to Existing Components

- This task expands upon the `minsky init` command's current rule installation capabilities
- It should be compatible with the planned `minsky rules` commands from task #029
- The rule library should support existing rule formats and conventions
- The system should work with both Cursor and generic AI rule formats

## Technical Considerations

- **Storage Location**: Consider using a dedicated package, GitHub repository, or registry
- **Update Mechanism**: Determine whether to use a package manager, Git, or custom solution
- **Versioning**: Design a semantic versioning scheme for rules and rule sets
- **Performance**: Ensure rule discovery and installation is efficient
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with existing rules in projects
- **Security**: Implement verification of rule sources and content
