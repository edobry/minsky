# Implement programmatic pending Drizzle migrations detection

## Context

Implement a programmatic, in-app way to detect pending Drizzle migrations without shelling out or applying them. Use drizzle-kit’s internal helpers to parse drizzle.config and establish connections, and drizzle-orm’s readMigrationFiles to compute pending vs applied. Provide a small library function and a CI-friendly script.
