# Add Mobile/Voice Interface for Minsky Operations

## Context

Minsky currently operates through CLI and MCP interfaces, requiring text-based interaction. A mobile/voice interface would provide natural language interaction similar to ChatGPT/Claude's voice mode, allowing users to perform any Minsky operation through conversational AI. This would significantly improve accessibility and user experience, especially for mobile users and hands-free scenarios.

## Objectives

1. **Voice-First Mobile Interface**

   - Native mobile app with voice recognition and synthesis
   - Real-time audio processing for natural conversation flow
   - Seamless integration with existing Minsky operations

2. **AI-Powered Natural Language Processing**

   - Leverage AI models to understand natural language commands
   - Convert voice commands to Minsky CLI operations
   - Provide intelligent context-aware responses

3. **Universal Operation Support**
   - Support all existing Minsky operations (tasks, sessions, git, etc.)
   - Enable complex workflows through conversational interaction
   - Maintain full feature parity with CLI interface

## Requirements

### Mobile Application

1. **Cross-Platform Mobile App**

3. **Command Translation Engine**
   - Natural language to Minsky CLI command mapping
   - Parameter extraction from conversational context
   - Error handling and clarification requests
   - Operation confirmation for destructive actions

### System Architecture

1. **Microservices Design**

   - Voice processing service
   - AI conversation service
   - Minsky operation service
   - Mobile API gateway

2. **Real-time Communication**
