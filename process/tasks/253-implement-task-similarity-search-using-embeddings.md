## Description

# Implement Task Similarity Search Using Embeddings

## Context

As our task management system grows and becomes more complex, we need intelligent ways to:

1. **Identify duplicate or similar tasks** - Prevent task duplication and consolidate related work
2. **Evaluate task relevance** - Determine which existing tasks are related to new work
3. **Identify task dependencies** - Discover implicit relationships between tasks
4. **Improve task discovery** - Help users find related tasks when working on similar problems
5. **Enhance AI task management** - Support the AI-powered task decomposition and analysis from Task #248

This task implements semantic similarity search for tasks using embeddings, leveraging the same embedding approach investigated in Task #179 for search-related MCP tools and mentioned in Task #182 for rule suggestions.

## Dependencies

1. **Task #179**: Builds on the embeddings/RAG investigation to use the same embedding technology and architecture patterns
2. **Task #160**: Requires AI completion backend for embedding generation (or leverages the embedding approach from #179)
3. **Task Hierarchy System**: Should integrate with parent-child relationships from Task #246 or #247
4. **Task #248**: Complements AI-powered task decomposition and analysis with similarity capabilities

## Objective

Implement a comprehensive task similarity search system that uses embeddings to find semantically similar tasks, enabling intelligent task management, duplicate detection, and dependency discovery.

minsky tasks create "Add login functionality" --check-duplicates

# Review potential duplicates
minsky tasks check-duplicate 123
```

### 2. Project Planning and Dependencies

```bash
# Find tasks that should be completed before a task
minsky tasks suggest-blockers 150

# Discover related tasks for sprint planning
minsky tasks similar 200 --threshold=0.6

# Analyze task relationships for project health
minsky tasks analyze-relationships --export=report.json
```

### 3. Task Maintenance and Cleanup

```bash
# Find potential duplicate tasks
minsky tasks find-duplicates --threshold=0.8

# Group related tasks for better organization
minsky tasks cluster --min-cluster-size=3

# Find orphaned or unrelated tasks
minsky tasks analyze-relationships --find-orphans
```

### 4. Enhanced Task Discovery

```bash
# Find tasks related to authentication
minsky tasks find-similar "authentication security login"

# Discover tasks similar to current work
minsky tasks similar $(minsky session get --current-task)
