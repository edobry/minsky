# Implement Task Similarity Search Using AI

## Context

As our task management system grows and becomes more complex, we need intelligent ways to:

1. **Identify duplicate or similar tasks** - Prevent task duplication and consolidate related work
2. **Evaluate task relevance** - Determine which existing tasks are related to new work
3. **Identify task dependencies** - Discover implicit relationships between tasks
4. **Improve task discovery** - Help users find related tasks when working on similar problems
5. **Enhance AI task management** - Support the AI-powered task decomposition and analysis from Task #248

This task implements semantic similarity search for tasks using AI completion, following the proven approach from Task #182 (rule suggestions). Embedding-based search will be added as a future enhancement when the infrastructure from Task #179/250 becomes available.

## Dependencies

1. **Task #160**: ✅ **DONE** - AI completion backend provides the foundation for similarity analysis
2. **Task #182**: ✅ **DONE** - Provides proven patterns for AI-powered semantic search and service architecture
3. **Task Hierarchy System**: Should integrate with parent-child relationships from Task #246 or #247
4. **Task #248**: Complements AI-powered task decomposition and analysis with similarity capabilities

## Future Enhancements (Not Blocking)

- **Task #179**: Embeddings/RAG investigation (when complete, will enhance performance)
- **Task #250**: Session-aware code search (when complete, will provide embedding infrastructure)

minsky tasks create "Add login functionality" --check-duplicates

# Review potential duplicates
minsky tasks check-duplicate 123
```

### 2. Project Planning and Dependencies

```bash
# Find tasks that should be completed before a task
minsky tasks suggest-blockers 150

# Discover related tasks for sprint planning
minsky tasks similar 200 --threshold=0.6

# Find orphaned or unrelated tasks
minsky tasks analyze-relationships --find-orphans
```

### 4. Enhanced Task Discovery

```bash
# Find tasks related to authentication
minsky tasks search "authentication security login"

# Discover tasks similar to current work
minsky tasks similar $(minsky session get --current-task)
