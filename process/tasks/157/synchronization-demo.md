# Synchronization Issue Demonstration

## Issue Demonstration Results

This document provides concrete evidence of the synchronization issues identified in the investigation.

## Scenario 1: Task Creation Synchronization Failure

**Steps Performed**:

1. Created task 157 in main workspace with title "Enhance Task Operations Synchronization Across Workspaces"
2. Task file was created: `process/tasks/157-enhance-task-operations-synchronization-across-workspaces.md`
3. **Issue**: Task was NOT added to `process/tasks.md` - the main task list

**Evidence**:

- Task file exists: `ls process/tasks/ | grep synchronization` shows the file
- Task not in main list: `grep -i synchronization process/tasks.md` returns no results
- Main tasks.md ends at #157 but with a different task: "Review and Modernize Project Documentation Architecture"

**Root Cause**: Task ID collision and creation process not properly synchronized

## Scenario 2: Session vs Main Workspace Status Divergence

**Steps Performed**:

1. Created session for task 157
2. From session workspace: `minsky tasks status set 157 IN-PROGRESS`
3. Session reported: `status: IN-PROGRESS` and `previousStatus: TODO`
4. Checked main workspace: `minsky tasks status get 157` still shows `TODO`

**Evidence**:

- Session workspace `process/tasks.md`: Shows `[+]` (IN-PROGRESS) for task 157
- Main workspace `process/tasks.md`: Shows `[ ]` (TODO) for task 157
- **Complete synchronization failure between workspaces**

## Session Assignment Issue

**Discovered Problem**:
When I ran `minsky session start 157`, it assigned me to the existing task #157 ("Review and Modernize Project Documentation Architecture") rather than the task I created about synchronization. This indicates:

1. **Task ID Collision**: Multiple tasks trying to use ID #157
2. **Session Assignment Logic**: Sessions get assigned to existing tasks with the same ID
3. **Task Visibility**: The synchronization task isn't visible in the main task list

## File System Evidence

### Main Workspace (`/Users/edobry/Projects/minsky`):

```bash
# Task exists as file but not in main list
$ ls process/tasks/ | grep synchronization
157-enhance-task-operations-synchronization-across-workspaces.md

# Task 157 in main tasks.md is different
$ grep "157" process/tasks.md
- [ ] Review and Modernize Project Documentation Architecture [#157](...)

# Status shows TODO
$ minsky tasks status get 157
taskId: #157
status: TODO
```

### Session Workspace (`/Users/edobry/.local/state/minsky/.../sessions/157`):

```bash
# Same task ID but different content and status
$ grep "157" process/tasks.md
- [+] Review and Modernize Project Documentation Architecture [#157](...)

# Status shows IN-PROGRESS
$ minsky tasks status get 157
taskId: #157
status: IN-PROGRESS
```

## Critical Issues Confirmed

1. **Task Creation Failures**: Tasks can be created as files but not properly registered in the main task list
2. **Workspace Isolation**: Session and main workspaces maintain completely separate task state
3. **Status Update Isolation**: Status changes in sessions don't propagate to main workspace
4. **ID Collision Handling**: System doesn't handle task ID collisions properly
5. **Session Assignment**: Sessions get assigned based on existing task IDs regardless of actual task content

## Impact Assessment

These synchronization issues create:

- **Data Inconsistency**: Different workspaces show different task states
- **Lost Work**: Updates made in sessions may be lost
- **User Confusion**: Users see different information depending on workspace context
- **Workflow Disruption**: Task management becomes unreliable across contexts
- **Race Conditions**: Multiple sessions can create conflicting state

This confirms the architectural problems identified in the investigation and validates the need for the proposed synchronization solution.
