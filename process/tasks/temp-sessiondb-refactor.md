# Task: Refactor SessionDB to Follow Functional Patterns

## Context

As part of our architectural improvement initiative, we're moving away from class-based, stateful designs to more functional patterns. The SessionDB module is central to many operations but currently uses a class-based approach with methods that have side effects, making testing difficult.

## Requirements

1.  **Extract Pure Functions**

    - Convert key SessionDB methods to pure, stateless functions
    - Make dependencies explicit through parameters
    - Ensure compatibility with existing SessionProviderInterface

2.  **Implement State Provider Pattern**

    - Extract state management to a dedicated store/provider
    - Make session state changes explicit and testable
    - Implement immutable patterns for state updates

3.  **Side Effect Isolation**

    - Isolate I/O operations (file system, etc.)
    - Create wrappers for side effects that can be easily mocked
    - Use dependency injection for all external operations

4.  **Apply Functional Composition**

    - Replace class methods with composed functions
    - Implement functional pipeline patterns for complex operations
    - Extract shared utilities to reusable functions

5.  **Update Tests**
    - Adapt existing tests to work with the functional approach
    - Add tests specifically for the pure functions
    - Verify that all existing functionality still works correctly

## Implementation Steps

1.  [ ] Identify core session operations:

    - [ ] Extract session CRUD operations as pure functions
    - [ ] Extract session query operations as pure functions
    - [ ] Create utility functions for common operations

2.  [ ] Implement state provider:

    - [ ] Create session state store with immutable updates
    - [ ] Implement state access functions
    - [ ] Add state management utilities

3.  [ ] Isolate side effects:

    - [ ] Create wrappers for file system operations
    - [ ] Separate I/O operations from business logic
    - [ ] Make side effects explicit in function signatures

4.  [ ] Apply functional composition:

    - [ ] Implement function composition for complex operations
    - [ ] Create pipeline patterns for data transformation
    - [ ] Ensure proper error handling with pure functions

5.  [ ] Update tests:
    - [ ] Refactor existing tests to use functional approach
    - [ ] Add tests for pure functions
    - [ ] Test state management separately from business logic

## Verification

- [ ] All tests pass with simpler mocking requirements
- [ ] Functions can be tested in isolation without side effects
- [ ] Code is more modular and follows functional programming principles
- [ ] Better error handling with explicit failure paths
- [ ] Maintains backward compatibility with existing interface
