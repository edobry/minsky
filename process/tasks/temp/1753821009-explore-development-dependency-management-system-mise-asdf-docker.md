# Task: Explore Development Dependency Management System

## Context

The current secret scanning implementation requires `gitleaks` binary but has no automated setup for developers. This creates barriers to contribution and inconsistent environments.

## Problem

- Gitleaks installed via `brew install gitleaks` in implementation session
- No guarantee other developers have gitleaks installed
- Pre-commit hook fails without gitleaks
- No documentation for required external tools
- Manual setup burden for new contributors

## Requirements

### 1. Evaluate Development Dependency Managers

**Primary Option: `mise`** (https://mise.jdx.dev/)
- Successor to `asdf`
- Cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Language-agnostic tool management
- Project-local `.mise.toml` configuration
- Automatic tool installation and version management

**Alternative Options:**
- `asdf` (original multi-tool manager)
- `rtx` (Rust-based alternative) 
- Docker-based development containers
- GitHub Codespaces configuration
- Platform-specific solutions (Homebrew Bundle, apt packages)

### 2. Implementation Requirements

**Automated Setup:**
- One-command setup for new developers
- Consistent tool versions across team
- Platform compatibility (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- CI/CD environment compatibility

**Configuration:**
- Project-local tool definitions
- Version pinning for reproducibility
- Integration with existing package.json scripts
- Documentation for manual fallback

### 3. Tool Coverage

**Current External Dependencies:**
- `gitleaks` (secret scanning)
- `bun` (runtime - already handled)
- Potential future: `just`, `fd`, `rg`, etc.

**Tool Lifecycle Management:**
- Installation automation
- Version updates
- Team synchronization
- CI/CD compatibility

## Success Criteria

- [ ] New developers can run one command to set up all tools
- [ ] Consistent tool versions across development environments
- [ ] CI/CD environments work without manual setup
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- [ ] Clear documentation and fallback instructions
- [ ] Integration with existing development workflow

## Investigation Areas

1. **Mise Evaluation:**
   - Configuration format and flexibility
   - Tool availability (especially gitleaks)
   - Performance and reliability
   - Team adoption considerations

2. **Alternative Approaches:**
   - Docker development containers
   - GitHub Codespaces configuration
   - Platform-specific solutions
   - Hybrid approaches

3. **Migration Strategy:**
   - Backwards compatibility with current setup
   - Gradual adoption path
   - Documentation and training needs

## Expected Outcomes

- Recommendation for development dependency management approach
- Implementation plan with configuration files
- Documentation for setup and usage
- Potential simplification of secret scanning (remove secondary scanner?)

## Priority

**High** - This blocks team productivity and creates barriers to contribution. The secret scanning implementation is incomplete without proper dependency management.
