# Task #178: Establish Codemod Best Practices and Standards

## Context

The Minsky project has accumulated 90+ codemods in the `codemods/` directory, representing significant experience in automated code transformation. Recent work has revealed critical insights about effective codemod development approaches.

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY FROM TASK #166**: AST-based approaches are **6x more effective** than regex-based approaches:
- AST-based fix-variable-naming-ast.ts: 231 fixes with 100% success rate, zero syntax errors
- Regex-based approaches: High syntax error rates, complex pattern matching, frequent failures

**KEY INSIGHT**: The most effective codemods address **root causes** rather than symptoms, using simple principles that handle multiple cases instead of complex pattern-specific solutions.

This task aims to:
1. Analyze existing codemods to extract proven patterns and anti-patterns
2. Establish AST-based approaches as the mandatory standard
3. Create comprehensive guidelines based on concrete evidence from recent work
4. Establish a standardized structure prioritizing safety and effectiveness

  - **MEDIUM EFFECTIVENESS**: ESLint output parsing and targeted fixes
  - **LOW EFFECTIVENESS**: Simple string/regex-based transformations (to be migrated)
  - **DEPRECATED**: Complex pattern-specific regex solutions
- **Identify effectiveness patterns:**
  - Root cause vs symptom treatment
  - Safety mechanisms and validation
  - Error handling and reporting
  - Performance and reliability metrics
  - Import management and AST manipulation
