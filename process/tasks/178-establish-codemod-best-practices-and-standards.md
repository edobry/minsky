# Task #178: Establish Codemod Best Practices and Standards

## Context

The Minsky project has accumulated 90+ codemods in the `codemods/` directory, representing significant experience in automated code transformation. However, there are no established standards or guidelines for writing effective, safe, and maintainable codemods. Recent work on the error pattern codemod (Task #169) revealed both effective patterns and areas for improvement.

This task aims to:
1. Analyze existing codemods to extract proven patterns and anti-patterns
2. Research industry best practices for codemod development
3. Create comprehensive guidelines and rules for future codemod development
4. Establish a standardized structure and approach for codemods

## Requirements

### 1. Codemod Analysis and Pattern Extraction

**Analyze Existing Codemods:**
- Review all 90+ codemods in the `codemods/` directory
- Categorize codemods by approach:
  - Simple string/regex-based transformations
  - ESLint output parsing and targeted fixes
  - TypeScript AST-based transformations (ts-morph, typescript compiler API)
  - Hybrid approaches
- Identify common patterns:
  - File discovery and filtering
  - Content parsing and analysis
  - Safety checks and validation
  - Error handling and reporting
  - Import management
  - Output formatting and logging

**Extract Success Patterns:**
- Document effective safety mechanisms
- Identify robust error handling approaches
- Catalog successful TypeScript/AST integration patterns
- Note effective testing and validation strategies

**Identify Anti-Patterns:**
- Document problematic approaches that led to issues
- Identify common failure modes
- Note maintenance and debugging challenges
- Catalog performance bottlenecks

### 2. Industry Best Practices Research

**Research Popular Codemod Libraries:**
- **jscodeshift**: Facebook's codemod toolkit
- **ts-morph**: TypeScript compiler API wrapper
- **recast**: JavaScript AST transformation toolkit
- **babel-codemod**: Babel-based transformations
- **ast-grep**: Tree-sitter based code search and transformation
- **comby**: Language-agnostic structural search and replace

**Evaluate Library Benefits:**
- Compare safety guarantees
- Assess ease of use and learning curve
- Evaluate performance characteristics
- Review community adoption and maintenance
- Analyze integration complexity

**Study Best Practices:**
- Review documentation and guides from major projects
- Analyze open-source codemod examples
- Research testing methodologies
- Study error handling and rollback strategies

### 3. Create Comprehensive Guidelines

**Develop Codemod Standards:**
- Establish file naming conventions
- Define required documentation standards
- Create template structure for new codemods
- Specify safety check requirements
- Define testing protocols

**Create Decision Framework:**
- When to use string/regex vs AST-based approaches
- How to choose between different AST libraries
- Guidelines for handling edge cases
- Strategies for incremental vs comprehensive transformations

**Establish Safety Protocols:**
- Mandatory backup/rollback procedures
- Required validation steps
- Error handling standards
- Progress reporting requirements

### 4. Create New Rule for Codemods Directory

**Rule Scope:**
- Apply to all files in `codemods/` directory
- Cover both new codemod creation and existing codemod maintenance

**Rule Content:**
- Mandatory structure and documentation requirements
- Safety check protocols
- Testing requirements
- Error handling standards
- Performance guidelines
- Maintenance and versioning practices

**Integration Requirements:**
- Integrate with existing cursor rules system
- Provide clear examples and templates
- Include troubleshooting guides
- Reference industry best practices

### 5. Practical Recommendations

**Tool Recommendations:**
- Recommend specific libraries for different use cases
- Provide migration paths from current approaches
- Suggest development workflow improvements

**Template Creation:**
- Create starter templates for common codemod types
- Provide example implementations
- Include comprehensive test suites

**Documentation Standards:**
- Require clear purpose statements
- Mandate safety consideration documentation
- Specify testing and validation procedures
- Include rollback instructions
