# Task #178: Establish Codemod Best Practices and Standards

## Context

The Minsky project has accumulated 90+ codemods in the `codemods/` directory, representing significant experience in automated code transformation. However, there are no established standards or guidelines for writing effective, safe, and maintainable codemods. Recent work on the error pattern codemod (Task #169) revealed both effective patterns and areas for improvement.

This task aims to:

1. Analyze existing codemods to extract proven patterns and anti-patterns
2. Research industry best practices for codemod development
3. Create comprehensive guidelines and rules for future codemod development
4. Establish a standardized structure and approach for codemods
