# Task #077: Implement Structured Logging System

## Context

The current project uses various `console.log`, `console.error`, and `console.warn` calls for outputting information, debugging, and error reporting. This approach lacks consistency, structure, and doesn't support different log levels or multiple output destinations.

A proper logging system would provide:

1. Consistent log formatting across the codebase
2. Support for different log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
3. The ability to direct different types of logs to different outputs
4. Better control over what is logged in production vs development environments
5. Structured logging for easier parsing and analysis
6. Separation between "program messages" (user-facing output) and "agent events" (system logs)

## Requirements

1. **Logging Library Selection**

   - Select a popular, well-maintained logging library (like Winston, Pino, or similar)
   - The library should be lightweight and have TypeScript support
   - It should support multiple transports/outputs

2. **Logger Implementation**

   - Create a centralized logger module that wraps the chosen library
   - Implement standard log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
   - Support structured logging with metadata
   - Implement log formatting that is readable for humans but also parseable
   - Configure sensible defaults for development and production environments

3. **Multiple Output Types**

   - Support console output for all logs
   - Implement separation between "program messages" (user output) and "agent events" (system logs)
   - Allow for future extension to other outputs (files, remote services, etc.)

4. **Codebase Migration**

   - Replace all `console.log`, `console.error`, and `console.warn` calls with the new logger
   - Categorize logs appropriately based on their purpose and content
   - Apply appropriate log levels to existing log statements

5. **Testing**
   - Add tests for the logger functionality
   - Ensure log capture/mocking works correctly in tests

## Implementation Steps

1. **Library Research and Selection**

   - [ ] Research available logging libraries compatible with TypeScript and Bun
   - [ ] Evaluate based on: features, performance, maintenance status, compatibility with project
   - [ ] Select the most appropriate library

2. **Logger Implementation**

   - [ ] Create a new `src/utils/logger.ts` module
   - [ ] Setup the chosen logging library with appropriate configuration
   - [ ] Implement a clean API with standardized log levels
   - [ ] Add support for structured metadata
   - [ ] Create separate streams for program messages vs agent events

3. **Testing Infrastructure**

   - [ ] Create tests for the logger module
   - [ ] Implement utilities for capturing/verifying logs in tests
   - [ ] Update existing test mocks that capture console output

4. **Codebase Migration**

   - [ ] Replace console.log calls with appropriate logger calls in domain modules
   - [ ] Replace console.error calls with logger.error across the codebase
   - [ ] Identify and properly categorize logs as program messages or agent events
   - [ ] Ensure consistent log formatting and information across modules

5. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Update developer documentation explaining the logging system
   - [ ] Add examples of proper logging usage
   - [ ] Document the different log levels and when to use each

## Verification

- [ ] All console.log/error/warn calls have been replaced with the new logger
- [ ] Logs have consistent formatting
- [ ] Different types of logs are properly categorized
- [ ] Log levels are used appropriately
- [ ] Tests pass and properly capture logs
- [ ] Documentation is complete
- [ ] Both "program messages" and "agent events" are correctly handled
