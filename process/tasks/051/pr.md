# feat(#51): Add Git Commands to MCP Server

## Summary

This PR implements Git command support in the MCP server, allowing AI assistants to interact with Git repositories programmatically. The implementation adds domain-level interface-agnostic functions for Git operations and exposes them through the MCP adapter, following strict session-first workflow principles.

## Changes

### Added

- Domain interface-agnostic functions for Git operations: `cloneFromParams`, `branchFromParams`, and `pushFromParams`
- MCP commands for Git operations: `git.clone`, `git.branch`, and `git.push`
- Git command documentation in README-MCP.md

### Changed

- Updated `registerGitTools` function to include the new Git commands
- Enhanced domain/index.ts to export the new Git functions

## Testing

The implementation has been manually tested by verifying the existence of the MCP commands and their parameter schemas. All changes were implemented following the session-first workflow using absolute paths in the session workspace.

## Checklist

- [x] All requirements implemented
- [x] Documentation is updated
- [x] Error handling is consistent with other MCP tools
- [x] All Git commands are properly registered in the MCP server
- [x] Changes follow session-first workflow principles
- [ ] Tests for Git MCP tools (pending)

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation followed these principles:

1. **Interface-Agnostic Domain Functions**

   - Created domain-level interface-agnostic functions for all Git operations
   - Functions follow the "FromParams" naming pattern established in the codebase
   - All functions properly propagate errors and include comprehensive logging

2. **MCP Adapter**

   - Extended the existing registerGitTools function to add new commands
   - Used Zod schemas for parameter validation
   - Maintained consistent patterns for error handling and response formatting

3. **Documentation**
   - Updated README-MCP.md with detailed information about the Git commands
   - Included parameter listings and descriptions

4. **Session-First Workflow**
   - All changes made in session workspace using absolute paths
   - Followed proper workflow isolation principles
   - Ensured changes were verified in the correct workspace

## Future Improvements

- Consider adding more Git operations like:
  - `git.status`: Get status of a repository
  - `git.log`: View commit history
  - `git.list-branches`: List all branches in a repository
