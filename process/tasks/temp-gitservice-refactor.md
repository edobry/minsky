# Task: Refactor GitService to Follow Functional Patterns

## Context

Our GitService is a key component of the system but is currently implemented as a class with stateful methods, making it difficult to test and reason about. As part of our move to more functional patterns, we need to refactor this service to use pure functions and explicit state management.

## Requirements

1.  **Extract Git Operations as Pure Functions**

    - Convert key GitService methods to pure, stateless functions
    - Make dependencies explicit through parameters
    - Ensure compatibility with existing GitServiceInterface

2.  **Isolate Shell Command Execution**

    - Create a dedicated wrapper for shell command execution
    - Make command execution testable and mockable
    - Separate command construction from execution

3.  **Implement State Management**

    - Extract state management to dedicated stores/providers
    - Make state changes explicit and testable
    - Implement immutable patterns for state updates

4.  **Apply Functional Composition**

    - Replace class methods with composed functions
    - Implement functional pipeline patterns for complex git operations
    - Extract shared utilities to reusable functions

5.  **Update Tests**
    - Adapt existing tests to work with the functional approach
    - Add tests specifically for the pure functions
    - Verify that all existing functionality still works correctly

## Implementation Steps

1.  [ ] Extract core git operations:

    - [ ] Extract repository operations (clone, branch, etc.) as pure functions
    - [ ] Extract commit operations (stage, commit, push) as pure functions
    - [ ] Extract PR operations as pure functions

2.  [ ] Implement shell command isolation:

    - [ ] Create a wrapper for executing git commands
    - [ ] Separate command construction from execution
    - [ ] Make command execution easily mockable

3.  [ ] Implement state management:

    - [ ] Create git state store with immutable updates
    - [ ] Implement state access functions
    - [ ] Add state management utilities

4.  [ ] Apply functional composition:

    - [ ] Implement function composition for complex git operations
    - [ ] Create pipeline patterns for command chaining
    - [ ] Ensure proper error handling with pure functions

5.  [ ] Update tests:
    - [ ] Refactor existing tests to use functional approach
    - [ ] Add tests for pure functions
    - [ ] Test command execution separately from business logic

## Verification

- [ ] All tests pass with simpler mocking requirements
- [ ] Git operations can be tested in isolation without side effects
- [ ] Shell command execution is properly isolated and mockable
- [ ] Better error handling with explicit failure paths
- [ ] Maintains backward compatibility with existing interface
