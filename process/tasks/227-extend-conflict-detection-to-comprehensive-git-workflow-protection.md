# Extend Conflict Detection to Comprehensive Git Workflow Protection

## Summary

Extend the ConflictDetectionService implementation from Task #221 to provide comprehensive conflict prevention across all git operations in the Minsky workflow, not just session PR creation.

## Background

Task #221 successfully implemented proactive conflict detection for session-to-main merges. This follow-up task expands that foundation to create a comprehensive git workflow protection system.

## Feature Extensions

### 1. Conflict Prevention for Other Git Operations

#### Branch Switching Warnings
- **Detect uncommitted changes** that would conflict with target branch
- **Warn before checkout** when switching would cause conflicts  
- **Suggest stash/commit strategies** before branch operations
- **Integration points**: `git checkout`, `git switch`, session start/resume

#### Merge Operation Previews  
- **Extend three-way merge simulation** to general merge operations
- **Preview merge results** before executing `git merge` commands
- **Conflict prediction for rebase operations** 
- **Integration points**: `git merge`, `git rebase`, manual merge commands

#### Rebase Conflict Prediction
- **Simulate rebase operations** to detect conflicts before execution
- **Identify problematic commits** in rebase sequence
- **Suggest conflict resolution strategies** for complex rebases
- **Integration points**: `git rebase`, session update operations

### 2. Advanced Auto-Resolution Strategies

#### Intelligent Conflict Handling
- **Renamed file conflicts**: Detect and auto-resolve simple renames
- **Import/dependency conflicts**: Handle package.json, lock files intelligently  
- **Formatting-only conflicts**: Auto-resolve conflicts that are only whitespace/formatting
- **Documentation conflicts**: Smart handling of README, changelog updates

#### Machine Learning Integration (Future)
- **Pattern recognition** for common conflict types in the codebase
- **User preference learning** for conflict resolution choices
- **Confidence scoring** for auto-resolution decisions

## Technical Requirements

### Core Service Extensions
- **Extend ConflictDetectionService** with new operation types
- **Add GitOperationPreview interface** for different git commands
- **Implement ConflictResolver** with pluggable resolution strategies
- **Create AdvancedResolutionEngine** for complex conflict scenarios

### CLI Integration
- **New flags for all git-related commands**:
  - `--preview`: Show conflict prediction before operation
  - `--auto-resolve`: Enable advanced auto-resolution
  - `--conflict-strategy`: Choose resolution approach
- **Enhanced error messaging** with operation-specific guidance
- **Interactive conflict resolution** prompts when needed

### Configuration Options
- **User preferences** for auto-resolution aggressiveness
- **Project-specific rules** for conflict handling patterns
- **Whitelist/blacklist** for auto-resolution file types

## Success Criteria

### ðŸŽ¯ Comprehensive Coverage
- [x] Branch switching with conflict detection
- [x] Merge operation previews working
- [ ] Rebase conflict prediction implemented
- [ ] Advanced auto-resolution for common patterns

### ðŸ”§ Technical Quality  
- [  ] All new functionality fully tested
- [  ] Performance impact minimal (<10% overhead)
- [  ] Backward compatibility maintained
- [  ] Error handling comprehensive

### ðŸ‘¥ User Experience
- [  ] Clear previews before potentially conflicting operations
- [  ] Intuitive CLI flags and options
- [  ] Helpful guidance for complex scenarios
- [  ] Reduced manual conflict resolution by 50%+

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- Extend ConflictDetectionService architecture
- Implement basic branch switching warnings
- Add merge operation previews

### Phase 2: Advanced Detection (Week 2)  
- Rebase conflict prediction
- Complex merge scenario handling
- Enhanced CLI integration

### Phase 3: Auto-Resolution (Week 3)
- Intelligent conflict resolution strategies
- File-type specific handling
- User preference system

### Phase 4: Polish & Performance (Week 4)
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive testing
- Documentation and examples

## Related Tasks

- **Builds on**: Task #221 (Better Merge Conflict Prevention)
- **Integrates with**: Session workflow, git operations
- **May require**: Configuration system updates, CLI framework enhancements

## Risk Assessment

- **High complexity**: Advanced auto-resolution requires careful logic
- **Performance impact**: Need to balance thorough checking with speed
- **User adoption**: Must not interfere with existing workflows
- **False positives**: Over-aggressive conflict detection could harm UX

## Priority

MEDIUM - Builds on proven foundation from Task #221

## Future Considerations

- Integration with external git tools (GitHub CLI, GitKraken, etc.)
- Support for complex merge strategies (ours, theirs, union)
- Conflict prevention for multi-repository workflows
- Team collaboration features (shared conflict resolution patterns)
