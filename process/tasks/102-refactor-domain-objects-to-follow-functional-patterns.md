# Task #102: Refactor Domain Objects to Follow Functional Patterns

**Note: This task has been marked as DONE and broken down into the following more focused subtasks:**

- **Task #106: Refactor SessionDB to Functional Patterns ([#106](mdc:tasks/106-refactor-sessiondb-to-functional-patterns-subtask-of-102-.md))**
- **Task #107: Refactor GitService to Functional Patterns ([#107](mdc:tasks/107-refactor-gitservice-to-functional-patterns-subtask-of-102-.md))**
- **Task #108: Refactor TaskService to Functional Patterns ([#108](mdc:tasks/108-refactor-taskservice-to-functional-patterns-subtask-of-102-.md))**

## Context

Our domain objects (SessionDB, GitService, TaskService) are designed with class-based, stateful architectures that make testing difficult. Many methods have side effects or rely on internal state. A more functional approach with pure functions and explicit dependencies would make the code more testable and maintainable.

## Requirements

1. **Pure Function Approach**

   - Convert key methods to pure, stateless functions
   - Make side effects explicit and pushed to the edges
   - Move away from class-based design to functional composition

2. **State Management**

   - Extract state management to dedicated stores/providers
   - Make state changes explicit and testable
   - Implement immutable patterns for state updates

3. **Side Effect Isolation**
   - Isolate I/O operations (file system, network, etc.)
   - Create wrappers for side effects that can be easily mocked
   - Use dependency injection for all external operations

## Implementation Steps

1. [x] -- Delegated to subtasks. Refactor SessionDB:

   - [x] -- Delegated to subtasks. Extract core operations to pure functions
   - [x] -- Delegated to subtasks. Create a state provider for session data
   - [x] -- Delegated to subtasks. Implement immutable update patterns

2. [x] -- Delegated to subtasks. Refactor GitService:

   - [x] -- Delegated to subtasks. Extract git operations to pure functions
   - [x] -- Delegated to subtasks. Isolate shell command execution
   - [x] -- Delegated to subtasks. Create testable wrappers for all git commands

3. [x] -- Delegated to subtasks. Refactor TaskService:

   - [x] -- Delegated to subtasks. Extract task operations to pure functions
   - [x] -- Delegated to subtasks. Implement store pattern for task state
   - [x] -- Delegated to subtasks. Separate backend implementations from core logic

4. [x] -- Delegated to subtasks. Update domain function implementations:

   - [x] -- Delegated to subtasks. Apply functional composition
   - [x] -- Delegated to subtasks. Eliminate hidden dependencies
   - [x] -- Delegated to subtasks. Ensure proper error handling with pure functions

5. [x] -- Delegated to subtasks. Update tests to leverage functional approach:
   - [x] -- Delegated to subtasks. Create test utilities for functional testing
   - [x] -- Delegated to subtasks. Implement property-based testing where appropriate
   - [x] -- Delegated to subtasks. Eliminate the need for complex mocking

## Verification

- [ ] All tests pass with simpler mocking requirements
- [ ] Functions can be tested in isolation without side effects
- [ ] Improved code reuse through functional composition
- [ ] Better error handling with explicit failure paths
