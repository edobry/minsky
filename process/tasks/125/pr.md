# feat(#125): Implement CLI Bridge for Shared Command Registry

## Summary

This PR implements a CLI bridge that automatically generates Commander.js commands from the shared command registry. This reduces code duplication between CLI and MCP interfaces by providing a single source of truth for command definitions.

## Changes

### Added

- Created `CliCommandBridge` class for converting shared commands to Commander.js commands
- Implemented `parameter-mapper.ts` to handle Zod schema to CLI option conversion
- Added `cli-command-factory.ts` to provide a clean API for the bridge
- Created CLI execution context for CLI-specific operations
- Implemented command customization system for fine-tuning generated commands
- Added support for command hierarchies with category-based organization
- Implemented a prototype integration with the "session list" command

### Changed

- Updated CLI entry point to support bridge-generated commands alongside manually created ones
- Fixed linter errors in implementation files to ensure code quality

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with a prototype using the "session list" command. The bridge successfully generates a Commander.js command that functions identically to the manually created version, supporting both text and JSON output.

## Checklist

- [x] All requirements implemented
- [x] All linter errors addressed
- [x] Code quality is acceptable
- [x] Documentation is updated
- [x] CHANGELOG.md is updated
