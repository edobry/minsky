# Task #030: Setup Project Tooling and Automation

## Context

Currently, the project lacks a standardized set of development tools and automation processes to ensure code quality, enforce consistency, and streamline development workflows. Proper tooling and automation are essential for maintaining code quality, reducing manual effort, and ensuring a consistent development experience across the team.

## Requirements

1. **Linting and Code Style Enforcement**
   - Install and configure ESLint for TypeScript
   - Set up Prettier for consistent code formatting
   - Configure husky pre-commit hooks to enforce linting and formatting
   - Enforce project-specific coding standards

2. **Testing Framework Enhancement**
   - Configure Bun test runner for optimal performance
   - Set up test coverage reporting
   - Implement test utilities for common testing patterns
   - Configure automatic test running on file changes during development

3. **Continuous Integration**
   - Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
   - Configure workflows for:
     - Running tests
     - Linting and code quality checks
     - Building the project
     - Generating documentation
   - Add status badges to README.md

4. **Dependency Management**
   - Set up automated dependency updates (e.g., Dependabot)
   - Implement audit process for security vulnerabilities
   - Configure package scripts for common operations

5. **Documentation Generation**
   - Configure TypeDoc for API documentation generation
   - Set up automated documentation builds
   - Implement documentation previews for PRs

6. **Development Environment**
   - Create consistent workspace settings for common editors
   - Implement containerized development environment
   - Add a development quickstart guide

## Implementation Steps

1. [ ] Linting and Code Style Setup
   - [ ] Install and configure ESLint with TypeScript support
   - [ ] Add Prettier for code formatting
   - [ ] Create consistent .eslintrc.json configuration
   - [ ] Set up husky and lint-staged for pre-commit hooks
   - [ ] Add npm scripts for linting and fixing

2. [ ] Testing Infrastructure
   - [ ] Configure Bun test runner with appropriate settings
   - [ ] Set up test coverage reporting
   - [ ] Create test utilities for common patterns
   - [ ] Add npm scripts for test operations
   - [ ] Configure watch mode for development testing

3. [ ] Continuous Integration
   - [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow files
   - [ ] Set up test workflow
   - [ ] Configure linting workflow
   - [ ] Add build workflow
   - [ ] Create documentation generation workflow
   - [ ] Add status badges to README.md

4. [ ] Dependency Management
   - [ ] Configure Dependabot
   - [ ] Set up npm audit processes
   - [ ] Add dependency update scripts
   - [ ] Document dependency management process

5. [ ] Documentation Tools
   - [ ] Install and configure TypeDoc
   - [ ] Set up documentation build process
   - [ ] Configure documentation preview in PR process
   - [ ] Add documentation status badge

6. [ ] Development Environment
   - [ ] Create editor configuration files
   - [ ] Set up containerized development environment
   - [ ] Document development environment setup
   - [ ] Add quickstart guide to README.md

7. [ ] Integration and Verification
   - [ ] Ensure all tools work together cohesively
   - [ ] Test automation on sample changes
   - [ ] Document the integrated toolchain
   - [ ] Create example workflow documentation

## Verification

- [ ] All linting rules are properly enforced on pre-commit
- [ ] Code formatting is consistent across the codebase
- [ ] Tests run successfully in the configured CI environment
- [ ] Test coverage reports are generated correctly
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflows complete successfully
- [ ] Documentation is generated and accessible
- [ ] Dependency updates are automatically suggested
- [ ] Developer can set up the environment with minimal steps
- [ ] All npm scripts work as expected
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks prevent non-compliant code from being committed
