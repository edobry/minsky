# Design Release-Based Changelog Management System

## Context

Design and implement a release-based changelog management system to replace the current append-only approach.

## Problem

Current changelog rule appends all changes to single CHANGELOG.md file, which will become unwieldy over time. Need version/release organization.

## Objectives

1. Research backend capabilities for release management
2. Design release-based changelog system
3. Explore database vs repo backend vs hybrid approach
4. Plan migration from current append-only system
5. Integrate with existing git/task workflows

## Key Questions

- Can repo backend handle releases/tags?
- Should we store releases in task database?
- How to migrate existing changelog entries?
- What automation is needed for release workflows?

## Implementation Areas

### 1. Release Management Commands

```bash
minsky release create <version>        # Create new release
minsky release add-entry <type> <desc> # Add changelog entry
minsky release finalize <version>      # Prepare release
minsky release publish <version>       # Create git tag/release
```

### 2. Enhanced Changelog Rule

- Update existing changelog rule to work with releases
- Support both legacy and new formats during transition
- Automated migration of existing changelog entries

## Deliverables

- Backend capability assessment
- Release management system design
- Migration plan for existing changelogs
- Updated changelog rule proposal
- Release workflow integration plan
