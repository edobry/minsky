# Add Google Tasks Backend Support

## Status

**ON HOLD** - Waiting for completion of task 141 (Repository Configuration System)

## Summary

Implement Google Tasks API integration as a task backend option to allow users to sync tasks with their Google Tasks account.

## Dependencies

- **Task 141**: Repository Configuration System must be completed first
  - This task requires a proper configuration system to manage Google API credentials
  - OAuth 2.0 authentication needs secure credential storage and management
  - Backend registration and selection requires the configuration architecture from task 141

## Requirements

### Core Functionality

- Implement Google Tasks API client integration
- Add authentication flow for Google Tasks API (OAuth 2.0)
- Support CRUD operations for tasks:
  - Create new tasks
  - Read/list tasks
  - Update existing tasks
  - Delete tasks
  - Mark tasks as completed/incomplete

### Backend Integration

- Create a new backend adapter that implements the existing task backend interface
- Ensure compatibility with existing task management workflows
- Support task metadata synchronization (title, description, due dates, status)
- Handle Google Tasks list management (create, read, update, delete task lists)

### Error Handling

- Implement proper error handling for API failures
- Handle authentication expiration and renewal
- Provide meaningful error messages for common issues
- Implement rate limiting and retry logic

### Configuration **[BLOCKED - Task 141]**

- Add configuration options for Google API credentials
- Support multiple Google accounts
- Allow users to select which Google Tasks list to sync with
- Provide options for sync frequency and conflict resolution
- **Requires**: Repository-level and user-level configuration system from task 141

### Testing

- Unit tests for Google Tasks API client
- Integration tests for the backend adapter
- End-to-end tests for task synchronization
- Mock tests for error scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **BLOCKED**: Task 141 must be completed first
- [ ] Users can authenticate with their Google account
- [ ] Tasks can be created, read, updated, and deleted via Google Tasks API
- [ ] Task synchronization works bidirectionally
- [ ] Error handling provides clear feedback to users
- [ ] Configuration allows customization of sync behavior
- [ ] All tests pass and provide adequate coverage

## Technical Notes

- Use Google Tasks API v1
- Implement OAuth 2.0 flow for authentication
- Consider using Google's official client libraries
- Ensure proper handling of API quotas and rate limits
- Design for extensibility to support other Google services in the future
- **Wait for task 141**: Credential management and backend registration system

## Implementation Blockers

1. **Credential Management**: Google OAuth 2.0 requires secure credential storage

   - Client ID and Client Secret need to be configured
   - Access tokens and refresh tokens need secure storage
   - Multiple account support requires proper configuration architecture

2. **Backend Registration**: Google Tasks backend needs to be integrated into the main system

   - TaskService needs configuration-driven backend selection
   - CLI commands need to support "google-tasks" backend option
   - Configuration system needs to handle backend-specific settings

3. **Configuration Schema**: Google Tasks specific configuration needs
   - OAuth application credentials
   - Default task list selection
   - Account-specific settings
   - Sync preferences and conflict resolution

## Post-Task 141 Implementation Plan

Once task 141 is completed, this task will require:

1. **Google Tasks Backend Implementation**

   - Implement GoogleTasksBackend class with proper TaskBackend interface
   - OAuth 2.0 authentication flow integration
   - Full CRUD operations with Google Tasks API

2. **Configuration Integration**

   - Add Google API credentials to global user config
   - Add Google Tasks backend to repository config options
   - Implement backend auto-detection for Google Tasks

3. **System Integration**
   - Register Google Tasks backend in TaskService
   - Add CLI support for google-tasks backend
   - Implement proper error handling and credential management

## Dependencies (Detailed)

- **Task 141**: Repository Configuration System
  - Configuration file format and schema
  - Credential management system
  - Backend registration architecture
  - User-level vs repository-level settings separation
