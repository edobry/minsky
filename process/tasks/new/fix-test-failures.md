# fix: Resolve test failures in domain module

## Summary

This PR fixes several test failures in the domain module that were occurring due to issues with mocking, readonly property access, and API compatibility. It implements proper dependency injection patterns to make the tests more maintainable and resilient.

## Changes

### Fixed

- Fixed `session-approve.test.ts` by implementing proper dependency injection for `getCurrentSession` and flexible parameter types
- Fixed `git-pr-workflow.test.ts` by using more reliable assertion patterns and proper mock object creation
- Fixed `repo-utils.test.ts` by implementing a proper test for current directory fallback without modifying readonly properties
- Fixed `workspace.ts` by adding missing `isSessionRepository` export alias
- Fixed `workspace.test.ts` by implementing proper dependency injection tests
- Removed unnecessary debugging console logs from production code

### Improved

- Enhanced test stability with more flexible dependency injection patterns
- Improved mock objects to avoid type casting and better match real implementations
- Added appropriate fallbacks in the code for optional dependencies to make testing easier

## Testing

All previously failing tests now pass correctly with improved maintainability. The implementation follows proper testing best practices by:
1. Using dependency injection instead of modifying readonly properties
2. Testing behavior without relying on implementation details
3. Using proper assertions that match the Bun test API
