# Add Google Tasks Backend Support

## Summary

Implement Google Tasks API integration as a task backend option to allow users to sync tasks with their Google Tasks account.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality

- Implement Google Tasks API client integration
- Add authentication flow for Google Tasks API (OAuth 2.0)
- Support CRUD operations for tasks:
  - Create new tasks
  - Read/list tasks
  - Update existing tasks
  - Delete tasks
  - Mark tasks as completed/incomplete

### Backend Integration

- Create a new backend adapter that implements the existing task backend interface
- Ensure compatibility with existing task management workflows
- Support task metadata synchronization (title, description, due dates, status)
- Handle Google Tasks list management (create, read, update, delete task lists)

### Error Handling

- Implement proper error handling for API failures
- Handle authentication expiration and renewal
- Provide meaningful error messages for common issues
- Implement rate limiting and retry logic

### Configuration

- Add configuration options for Google API credentials
- Support multiple Google accounts
- Allow users to select which Google Tasks list to sync with
- Provide options for sync frequency and conflict resolution

### Testing

- Unit tests for Google Tasks API client
- Integration tests for the backend adapter
- End-to-end tests for task synchronization
- Mock tests for error scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can authenticate with their Google account
- [ ] Tasks can be created, read, updated, and deleted via Google Tasks API
- [ ] Task synchronization works bidirectionally
- [ ] Error handling provides clear feedback to users
- [ ] Configuration allows customization of sync behavior
- [ ] All tests pass and provide adequate coverage

## Technical Notes

- Use Google Tasks API v1
- Implement OAuth 2.0 flow for authentication
- Consider using Google's official client libraries
- Ensure proper handling of API quotas and rate limits
- Design for extensibility to support other Google services in the future

## Dependencies

- Google Tasks API access
- OAuth 2.0 authentication library
- HTTP client for API requests
- Configuration management for API credentials
