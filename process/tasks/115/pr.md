# feat(#115): Implement dependency injection test patterns with practical utilities

## Summary

This PR implements Task #115, delivering practical dependency injection test patterns that build on the successful foundation established in Task 114's migration of 26+ tests. The implementation focuses on documenting proven patterns and adding minimal, high-value utilities rather than complex enterprise frameworks.

## Motivation & Context

Task 114 successfully migrated 26+ high-priority tests to native Bun patterns, establishing working DI testing utilities in `src/utils/test-utils/`. However, the successful patterns from Task 114 weren't documented for other developers to follow, and some common test scenarios required significant boilerplate. This PR addresses those gaps by:

- Documenting the proven DI patterns that worked in Task 114
- Adding small, practical utilities to reduce boilerplate for common scenarios
- Providing clear guidance on when to use which pattern
- Maintaining backward compatibility with existing successful tests

The task explicitly avoided "over-engineering and enterprisey" solutions in favor of practical, immediate value for developers.

## Design Approach

We analyzed the successful patterns from Task 114 and identified three main DI testing approaches:

1. **Manual DI Pattern** - For domain functions with complex dependencies
2. **Spy Pattern** - For adapters, commands, and integration points
3. **Utility Helper Pattern** - For simple tests and utilities

Rather than creating complex abstractions, we focused on:

- Clear documentation with decision trees
- Simple scenario helpers that reduce common boilerplate
- Backward compatibility with existing working patterns
- Immediate usability without learning curves

## Key Changes

### Pattern Documentation

- **`di-patterns-analysis.md`** - Comprehensive analysis of Task 114 successes and identified practical gaps
- **`di-testing-patterns-guide.md`** - Decision guide with clear when-to-use guidance for each pattern
- Migration examples showing before/after patterns from Jest/Vitest to Bun

### Scenario Helpers

Enhanced `src/utils/test-utils/dependencies.ts` with practical utilities:

<pre><code class="language-typescript">
// Simple, clear intent for basic dependency setup
export function createSimpleDeps(overrides = {}): DomainDependencies

// Pre-configured task service with test data
export function createDepsWithTestTask(taskOverrides = {}, depOverrides = {}): DomainDependencies

// Pre-configured session provider with test data
export function createDepsWithTestSession(sessionOverrides = {}, depOverrides = {}): DomainDependencies
</code></pre>

### Documentation Improvements

Updated `src/utils/test-utils/README.md` with:

- **Quick Scenario Helpers section** with practical before/after examples
- Clear usage patterns for new helpers
- Integration guidance showing helper combinations

### Boilerplate Reduction Examples

Before Task 115:

<pre><code class="language-typescript">
const deps = createTestDeps({
  taskService: {
    getTask: createMock(() => Promise.resolve({
      id: "#123",
      title: "Test Task",
      status: "TODO",
      description: "Test description",
      worklog: []
    }))
  }
});
</code></pre>

After Task 115:

<pre><code class="language-typescript">
const deps = createDepsWithTestTask({ status: "TODO" });
</code></pre>

## Breaking Changes

None. All changes maintain full backward compatibility with existing tests and patterns.

## Testing

- **Validation Testing** - All existing tests continue to pass without modification
- **New Helper Testing** - Created temporary test file to validate new helpers work correctly
- **Documentation Testing** - All code examples in documentation are tested and functional
- **Pattern Verification** - Verified new helpers integrate properly with existing test utilities

## Impact Metrics

- **Documentation Created**: 3 comprehensive guides (analysis, decision guide, README updates)
- **New Utilities Added**: 3 working scenario helpers that provide immediate value
- **Tests Passing**: 100% (existing + new validation tests)
- **Boilerplate Reduction**: Common scenarios reduced from 8+ lines to 1 line
- **Backward Compatibility**: 100% maintained

## Verification Protocol

The improvements were validated through:

1. **Existing test continuity** - All 26+ migrated tests from Task 114 continue working
2. **New helper functionality** - Temporary validation tests confirm helpers work as intended
3. **Documentation accuracy** - All examples are tested and functional
4. **Integration testing** - New helpers properly compose with existing utilities

## Future Adoption Strategy

The new patterns will be adopted organically as developers:

- Write new tests and discover the helpers in documentation
- Modify existing tests and choose to use simpler helpers
- Reference the decision guide when choosing testing approaches
- Benefit from reduced boilerplate in common scenarios

No forced migration is required or recommended - existing tests work perfectly and the new utilities are purely additive improvements.
