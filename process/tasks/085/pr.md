# test(#085): Migrate CLI adapter tests to test domain methods instead

## Summary

Migrated CLI/MCP integration tests to use domain methods directly instead of testing through interfaces. This follows the testing-boundaries rule which emphasizes testing domain logic rather than interfaces. The change ensures better test coverage for the core functionality while maintaining proper test isolation.

## Changes

### Added
- New domain method tests for session operations (getSessionFromParams, listSessionsFromParams, deleteSessionFromParams, startSessionFromParams)
- New domain method tests for rules operations (listRules, getRule, searchRules, createRule)
- Proper mocking patterns using centralized test utilities

### Changed
- Replaced placeholder tests with proper domain method tests
- Improved test structure following project testing best practices
- Migrated tests to focus on domain logic instead of CLI/MCP interfaces
- Updated task specification with progress tracking and remaining work items

### Removed
- Placeholder tests that were using expect(true).toBe(true)
- Removed unnecessary direct testing of interface implementations

## Testing

All tests have been run and pass both in the task workspace. The tests properly isolate domain logic from interface implementation details, making them more maintainable and less prone to breaking when interface details change.
