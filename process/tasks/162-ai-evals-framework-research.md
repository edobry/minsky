## Status

BACKLOG

## Priority

HIGH

## Description

Design and implement a comprehensive evaluation framework for testing the efficacy of rules, context construction strategies, and agent operations within the Minsky system. This task is **heavily research-focused** and requires deep analysis of the evaluation landscape before any implementation work begins.

## Objectives

### Primary Research Phase (REQUIRED BEFORE ANY CODE)

Conduct extensive research into AI evaluation methodologies and frameworks, with particular focus on:

1. **AI Evals Approaches & Best Practices**

   - Study various approaches to AI evaluation (accuracy, safety, capability, robustness)
   - Understand how different organizations approach AI system evaluation
   - Research methodologies for evaluating agent behavior and rule compliance
   - Analyze approaches for measuring context construction effectiveness

2. **Eval Framework Architecture**

   - How are evaluation frameworks typically structured?
   - What are the key components (data management, execution, reporting, analysis)?
   - How do evaluation frameworks integrate with existing software development workflows?
   - What are the performance and scalability considerations?

3. **Integration with Software Testing**

   - Do teams typically use existing test frameworks (Jest, Mocha, pytest) for evals?
   - What are the pros/cons of leveraging test infrastructure vs. specialized eval tools?
   - How do evaluation suites integrate with CI/CD pipelines?
   - What testing patterns work well for non-deterministic AI systems?

4. **Tooling and Infrastructure**

   - Research prompt management libraries/frameworks for versioning and reproducibility
   - Investigate reporting and analytics approaches (dashboards, metrics, trend analysis)
   - Analyze self-hosted vs. platform-based solutions
   - Study approaches to eval data management and versioning

5. **Evaluation Design Patterns**
   - How to design meaningful, reliable evaluations for rule compliance
   - Approaches to measuring context construction quality
   - Methods for evaluating agent decision-making and task completion
   - Strategies for handling non-deterministic behavior in evaluations

## Example Evaluation Types to Support

The framework should eventually support evaluations such as:

1. **Rule Compliance Testing**

   - Given a sample code file and specific change instructions
   - Verify that particular rules are followed appropriately
   - Measure consistency of rule application across similar scenarios
   - Test rule interaction and conflict resolution

2. **Context Construction Efficacy**

   - Evaluate whether agents gather sufficient context for decisions
   - Test context relevance and completeness
   - Measure efficiency of information gathering strategies

3. **Agent Task Performance**

   - End-to-end task completion success rates
   - Quality of outputs (code, documentation, analysis)
   - Adherence to workflow protocols and best practices

4. **Robustness and Edge Cases**
   - Performance under unusual or challenging conditions
   - Handling of ambiguous or conflicting instructions
   - Recovery from errors or unexpected states

## Research Deliverables

Before any implementation work begins, produce:

1. **Comprehensive Literature Review**

   - Survey of existing eval frameworks and approaches
   - Analysis of strengths/weaknesses of different methodologies
   - Recommendations for our specific use case

2. **Architecture Design Document**

   - Proposed framework structure and components
   - Integration strategy with existing Minsky infrastructure
   - Data flow and execution model

3. **Technology Stack Analysis**

   - Evaluation of tools, libraries, and frameworks
   - Recommendations for prompt management, reporting, and execution
   - Decision matrix for self-hosted vs. platform solutions

4. **Implementation Roadmap**
   - Phased approach to building the framework
   - Dependencies and prerequisites
   - Success metrics and validation criteria

## Constraints

- **NO CODE IMPLEMENTATION** until research phase is complete and reviewed
- Focus on approaches that don't require hosted platforms (self-contained solutions preferred)
- Must integrate well with existing Minsky architecture and tooling
- Should leverage TypeScript/Bun ecosystem where possible
- Must support reproducible, versioned evaluations

## Research Questions to Address

1. What evaluation methodologies are most effective for rule-based AI systems?
2. How can we ensure eval reproducibility and consistency over time?
3. What metrics best capture rule compliance and context construction quality?
4. How should we handle the inherent variability in LLM responses?
5. What's the right balance between comprehensive evaluation and execution speed?
6. How can we make evaluations actionable for improving rules and agent behavior?

## Success Criteria

- Comprehensive understanding of eval framework landscape
- Clear architectural vision for Minsky-specific implementation
- Technology stack recommendations with justification
- Detailed implementation plan with realistic timelines
- Framework design that addresses our specific evaluation needs

## Dependencies

- Understanding of current Minsky rule system and agent architecture
- Access to representative scenarios and use cases for testing
- Ability to analyze existing agent interactions and outcomes

## Notes

This task represents a significant investment in understanding the evaluation problem space before committing to any particular implementation approach. The research phase is critical for making informed decisions about framework design and avoiding costly architectural mistakes.

The evaluation framework will ultimately be a foundational component for improving Minsky's effectiveness, so thorough research and thoughtful design are essential.
