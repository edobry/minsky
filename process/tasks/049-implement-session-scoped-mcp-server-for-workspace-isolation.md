# Implement Session-Scoped MCP Server for Workspace Isolation

## Context

The current Minsky workflow heavily relies on the `session-first-workflow.mdc` rule to ensure AI coding agents only modify files within session workspaces. However, AI agents frequently use relative paths with the `edit_file` tool, resulting in unintended modifications to the main workspace. This violates the core principle that all task-related changes must occur exclusively within session workspaces.

Minsky has recently added MCP (Model Context Protocol) support, providing an opportunity to implement proper workspace isolation at the tooling level rather than relying solely on rule-based enforcement.

## Requirements

1. **Session-Scoped MCP Integration**

   - Enhance the `session start` command to automatically configure and optionally launch an MCP server scoped to the session workspace
   - Ensure all file operations performed via MCP tools are restricted to the session workspace
   - Provide automatic path resolution that converts relative paths to absolute paths within the session workspace

2. **Path Resolution Safety**

   - Implement a robust path resolution system that prevents any file operations outside the session directory
   - Handle relative paths by resolving them within the session workspace context
   - Block or warn about any attempted file operations targeting the main workspace
   - Provide clear error messages for path violations

3. **MCP Server Architecture Design**

   - Research and evaluate different architectural approaches:
     - Central MCP server that routes tool calls based on session parameters
     - Independent MCP servers per session with scoped tool names
     - Hybrid approach with centralized routing but session-specific controls
   - Consider performance, security, and maintainability tradeoffs

4. **Cursor API Compatibility**

   - Ensure the MCP server exposes a complete set of tools compatible with the Cursor AI coding agent API
   - Create workspace-aware wrappers for all file-modifying tools that enforce isolation
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing AI workflow expectations

5. **Session Context Management**
   - Design a system to track active session context for MCP interactions
   - Support explicit session ID/path parameters for MCP tool calls
   - Create a mechanism for AI agents to discover and connect to the session-specific MCP endpoint

- **Error Handling**: Provide clear, actionable error messages for boundary violations
- **Configuration**: Support flexible configuration for different use cases
- **Testing**: Implement robust testing for security boundaries
