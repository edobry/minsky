# Implement Session-Scoped MCP Server for Workspace Isolation

## Context

The current Minsky workflow heavily relies on the `session-first-workflow.mdc` rule to ensure AI coding agents only modify files within session workspaces. However, AI agents frequently use relative paths with the `edit_file` tool, resulting in unintended modifications to the main workspace. This violates the core principle that all task-related changes must occur exclusively within session workspaces.

Minsky has recently added MCP (Model Context Protocol) support, providing an opportunity to implement proper workspace isolation at the tooling level rather than relying solely on rule-based enforcement.

## Updated Analysis

After comprehensive analysis of the current architecture and future direction:

1. **Root Cause**: AI tools resolve relative paths against the main workspace, not the session workspace
2. **Architecture Alignment**: Solution must align with domain-driven design and interface-agnostic patterns
3. **Future Compatibility**: Must support planned non-filesystem workspaces and database backends
4. **Pattern Consistency**: Should follow "preventing bypass patterns" architectural principles

### Current System Behavior

The core issue stems from how AI coding agents interact with the filesystem:

1. Tools like `edit_file` resolve paths relative to the main workspace root
2. Even when an AI agent believes it's operating in a session directory, its file operations may target the main workspace
3. This creates an inherent conflict with Minsky's strict session isolation requirements
4. The current approach relies solely on rule-based enforcement, which is prone to human error and isn't technically enforced

### Selected Approach: Session-Aware Tools with Local Filesystem

For the **current local filesystem implementation**, we're implementing session-aware tools that:

- Require explicit session parameters for all operations
- Enforce session workspace boundaries through path validation
- Use centralized MCP server for resource efficiency
- Provide clear separation between standard and session-scoped tools

### Future Docker Considerations

**Note**: While this task focuses on local filesystem implementation, the architecture is designed to support future Docker containerization where session workspaces will run in containers. The session-aware tools approach will adapt well to container-based workspaces by routing operations to container APIs instead of local filesystem operations.

## Requirements

1. **Session-Scoped File Operation Tools**

   - Create comprehensive session-aware file operation tools in the MCP server
   - Tools must require explicit session parameters for all operations
   - Ensure all file operations are restricted to the specified session workspace
   - Provide automatic path resolution within the session workspace context

2. **Path Resolution Safety**

   - Implement robust path validation that prevents operations outside session boundaries
   - Handle relative paths by resolving them within the session workspace context
   - Block operations targeting the main workspace or other session workspaces
   - Provide clear, actionable error messages for path violations

3. **Single Persistent MCP Server Architecture**

   - Use one persistent MCP server that handles all session operations
   - Implement session routing based on explicit session parameters
   - Avoid per-session server instances for resource efficiency
   - Support multiple concurrent sessions through parameter-based routing

4. **Session Context Management**

   - Implement session lookup and validation utilities
   - Support session identification by name or task ID
   - Validate session existence and status before operations
   - Provide session workspace path resolution from session database

5. **Security and Isolation**
   - Enforce strict boundaries between session workspaces
   - Prevent accidental cross-session contamination
   - Block path traversal attempts and other security vulnerabilities
   - Maintain audit trail of all session file operations

3. User tells AI: "Work on task #049"
4. AI agent uses session tools with explicit session parameters
```

### **Session Tool Architecture**

```
