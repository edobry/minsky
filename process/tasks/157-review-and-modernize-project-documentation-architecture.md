# Task #157: Review and Modernize Project Documentation Architecture

## Summary

Review the current state of the Minsky project's design and architecture, compare it to existing README and documentation, and modernize the documentation to accurately reflect the current implementation while improving its structure and accessibility.

## Priority

**Medium** - This is important for maintainability and onboarding but not critical for current functionality.

## Background

The Minsky project has evolved significantly since its initial documentation was written. The codebase now includes:

- A comprehensive CLI interface with multiple commands
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration
- Task management system with multiple backends
- Session management capabilities
- Git workflow integration
- Complex domain architecture with adapters pattern
- Extensive test infrastructure

The current documentation may not accurately reflect these architectural changes and improvements.

## Requirements

### 1. Architecture Review and Analysis

- [ ] Conduct comprehensive review of current codebase architecture
- [ ] Document the actual module structure and dependencies
- [ ] Identify key architectural patterns (domain-driven design, adapter pattern, etc.)
- [ ] Map the command interface structure and CLI architecture
- [ ] Document the MCP integration architecture
- [ ] Analyze the task management and session management systems

### 2. Documentation Audit

- [ ] Review existing README.md and all documentation files
- [ ] Identify gaps between documented and actual functionality
- [ ] Catalog outdated or incorrect information
- [ ] Assess documentation structure and navigation
- [ ] Review code examples and usage instructions for accuracy

### 3. Documentation Modernization

- [ ] Update README.md to reflect current project state
- [ ] Restructure documentation for better logical flow
- [ ] Create or update architectural overview documentation
- [ ] Improve getting started guide with current installation/setup process
- [ ] Update CLI command documentation with current interface
- [ ] Document MCP server functionality and integration
- [ ] Create clear examples of common workflows

### 4. Structure Improvements

- [ ] Reorganize documentation files for better discoverability
- [ ] Create a documentation index or navigation guide
- [ ] Ensure consistent formatting and style across all docs
- [ ] Add table of contents where appropriate
- [ ] Cross-reference related documentation sections

### 5. Content Enhancement

- [ ] Add missing documentation for new features
- [ ] Improve code examples and usage scenarios
- [ ] Document common troubleshooting scenarios
- [ ] Add contributor guidelines if missing
- [ ] Update any outdated dependencies or requirements

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Accuracy**: All documentation accurately reflects the current codebase state
2. **Completeness**: Major features and architectural components are documented
3. **Structure**: Documentation follows a logical, navigable structure
4. **Usability**: New users can successfully set up and use the project following the docs
5. **Maintainability**: Documentation structure supports easy future updates

## Implementation Notes

- Focus on the most user-facing documentation first (README, getting started)
- Consider creating separate architectural documentation for developers vs. user-facing docs
- Preserve any historical context that remains valuable
- Ensure code examples are tested and working
- Consider adding diagrams for complex architectural concepts

## Estimated Effort

**Large** - This involves comprehensive review and substantial writing/restructuring work.

## Dependencies

None - this is primarily a documentation task that can be completed independently.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] README.md accurately describes current project state and capabilities
- [ ] All major features and commands are documented
- [ ] Documentation structure is logical and navigable
- [ ] Code examples are current and functional
- [ ] Getting started guide successfully onboards new users
- [ ] Architecture documentation explains current design patterns
- [ ] All outdated information has been removed or updated
