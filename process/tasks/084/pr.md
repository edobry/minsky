# feat(#84): Extend Auto-Detection to Additional Commands

## Summary

This PR extends the auto-detection functionality implemented in Task #070 to additional CLI commands in Minsky. The auto-detection feature allows users to operate on the current session/task without explicitly providing IDs when in a session workspace, making the CLI more intuitive and user-friendly.

## Changes

### Added

- Added auto-detection to `tasks status set` command:
  - Made task-id argument optional
  - Implemented auto-detection using `getCurrentSessionContext`
  - Added clear feedback message when auto-detection is used
  - Added comprehensive unit tests for new auto-detection functionality

### Changed

- Updated task spec to reflect current command structure, replacing references to `git pr` with `git summary` and `session cd` with `session dir`
- Verified that `git summary`, `session update`, and `session dir` commands already use auto-detection correctly
- Standardized user feedback for all auto-detecting commands

### Fixed

- Fixed inconsistencies in task specification to accurately reflect the current command structure

## Testing

Changes were tested with unit tests that verify:
- Auto-detection works when a task ID is not provided
- Explicit task IDs are used when provided (overriding auto-detection)
- Appropriate error handling when auto-detection fails

## Checklist

- [x] All requirements implemented
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] Code quality is acceptable
- [x] Documentation is updated
- [x] Changelog is updated
