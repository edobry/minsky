# Implement Task Routing System for Automated Implementation Planning

## Status
TODO

## Priority
HIGH

## Category
PLANNING

## Context

Currently, creating implementation plans and task sequences requires manual analysis of dependencies, effort estimates, and strategic priorities. When planning complex tasks like **Task #441** (Subagent System), we manually analyze the "tech tree" of dependencies to determine the optimal sequence of work.

We need an automated **"route to this task"** system that can analyze the task dependency graph and generate optimal implementation sequences, similar to pathfinding algorithms in games or navigation systems. This system would automatically produce implementation plans that traverse from the current state to any target task.

## Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Dependency Graph Analysis**: Analyze task relationships to build comprehensive dependency graphs
2. **Pathfinding Algorithm**: Implement intelligent routing from current state to target tasks
3. **Implementation Planning**: Generate prioritized, sequenced implementation plans
4. **Parallelization Detection**: Identify tasks that can be worked on simultaneously
5. **Value Optimization**: Consider immediate user value alongside dependency requirements

### Secondary Goals

1. **Interactive Planning**: Enable exploration of different routing strategies
2. **Progress Tracking**: Update routes as tasks are completed
3. **What-If Analysis**: Explore impact of completing certain tasks first
4. **Resource Planning**: Consider effort estimates and team capacity

## Core Features

### 1. Task Dependency Graph Construction

**Graph Building**:
- Parse task specifications for dependency references
- Build directed acyclic graph (DAG) of task relationships
- Identify different dependency types (blocking, optional, enhancing)
- Detect circular dependencies and provide warnings
- Support for complex dependency patterns (OR dependencies, conditional dependencies)

**Dependency Types**:
- **Blocking Dependencies**: Must be completed before target task
- **Optional Dependencies**: Helpful but not required
- **Enhancing Dependencies**: Improve implementation but can be deferred
- **Parallel Dependencies**: Can be worked on simultaneously
- **Infrastructure Dependencies**: Shared components needed by multiple tasks

### 2. Current State Assessment

**Completion Status Analysis**:
- Identify all completed, in-progress, and pending tasks
- Assess partial completion states and work-in-progress
- Evaluate available infrastructure and capabilities
- Consider team skills and resource availability

**Readiness Evaluation**:
- Determine which tasks are immediately actionable
- Identify tasks blocked by dependencies
- Calculate readiness scores based on dependency completion
- Flag tasks with missing prerequisites

### 3. Pathfinding and Routing Algorithm

**Core Algorithm**:
- Implement modified Dijkstra's algorithm for task graphs
- Weight edges based on effort, value, and strategic priority
- Support for multi-objective optimization (time vs. value vs. risk)
- Handle parallel execution paths and resource constraints

**Routing Strategies**:
- **Shortest Path**: Minimum total effort to reach target
- **Highest Value First**: Prioritize tasks with immediate user benefit
- **Risk Minimization**: Prefer well-understood, low-risk tasks
- **Parallel Optimization**: Maximize concurrent work opportunities
- **Custom Weights**: User-defined priority adjustments

### 4. Implementation Plan Generation

**Plan Structure**:
- Phase-based organization with clear milestones
- Parallel execution tracks where possible
- Effort estimates and resource requirements
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Value delivery timeline and user benefits

**Output Formats**:
- Human-readable implementation plans
- Gantt chart data for project management tools
- JSON/YAML for programmatic consumption
- Interactive visualization of dependency graphs

### 5. Dynamic Re-routing

**Adaptive Planning**:
- Update routes as tasks are completed or priorities change
- Recalculate optimal paths when new dependencies are discovered
- Handle blocked tasks by finding alternative routes
- Support for emergency re-prioritization

**Progress Integration**:
- Monitor task completion status automatically
- Adjust remaining effort estimates based on progress
- Identify when routes need recalculation
- Provide progress reports against planned sequences
