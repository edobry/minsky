## Description

# Task Management UI System

## Overview

Design and implement a comprehensive task management UI for Minsky that provides visualization, interaction, and management capabilities for tasks, dependencies, and workflows. The system should explore multiple implementation approaches and provide a flexible architecture that can integrate with existing task backends while offering Minsky-specific enhancements.

## Related Tasks

- **Task #251 (Mobile/Voice Interface)**: Shares potential chat UI components and backend architecture. The task management UI could include voice capabilities and conversational task management, while both systems could benefit from a unified chat interface that Minsky controls rather than relying on external services permanently.

## Goals

1. **Provide visual task management**: Create an intuitive interface for viewing, managing, and interacting with tasks
2. **Support multiple backend integrations**: Explore integration with GitHub Issues, Linear, and other task management platforms
3. **Enable Minsky-specific workflows**: Support task spec regeneration, session management, and dependency visualization
4. **Offer flexible deployment options**: Evaluate web app, VSCode extension, and terminal-based approaches
5. **Chat UI Integration**: Develop a Minsky-controlled chat interface that can be shared with voice/mobile interfaces (Task #251)

## Requirements

### Core Features

1. **Task Visualization**

   - Display task graph with dependencies
   - Show task status and progress
   - Support filtering and search capabilities
   - Provide different view modes (list, graph, timeline)

2. **Task Management**

   - Create, edit, and delete tasks
   - Manage task dependencies
   - Update task status and properties
   - Support task spec regeneration workflow

3. **Session Integration**

   - Show tasks associated with sessions
   - Display session status and history
   - Support session branching and merging
   - Track session-task relationships

4. **Dependency Management**

   - Visualize task dependencies as a graph
   - Support dependency creation and modification
   - Detect and handle circular dependencies
   - Show impact analysis for task changes

5. **Time-based Views**

   - Show task timeline and history
   - Display "truncated subgraphs" when specs are recomputed
   - Track changes and evolution over time
   - Support versioning and rollback capabilities

6. **Chat UI and Voice Integration**
   - Implement Minsky-controlled chat interface for conversational task management
   - Support natural language task creation and modification
   - Provide voice command capabilities (integration with Task #251)
   - Enable text-to-speech for task updates and notifications
   - Support both external AI services (initial) and self-hosted AI backend (future)

### Technical Requirements

1. **Backend Integration**

   - Support multiple task backends (JSON file, GitHub Issues, Linear, etc.)
   - Provide unified API for different backends
   - Handle backend-specific limitations and features
   - Support read/write operations across backends

2. **Real-time Updates**

   - Live updates when tasks change
   - Support multiple concurrent users
   - Handle conflict resolution
   - Provide optimistic updates

3. **Performance**
   - Efficient rendering of large task graphs
   - Support for incremental loading
   - Caching and optimization strategies
   - Responsive user interface

## Implementation Approaches to Explore

### 1. Web Application

- **Pros**: Cross-platform, rich UI capabilities, easy deployment
- **Cons**: Requires separate server, potential security concerns
- **Technologies**: React/Vue.js, D3.js for graphs, WebSocket for real-time updates

### 2. VSCode Extension

- **Pros**: Integrated development environment, familiar interface
- **Cons**: Limited to VSCode users, extension API constraints
- **Technologies**: VSCode Extension API, webview panels

### 3. Terminal-based UI (Warp integration)

- **Pros**: Lightweight, fits developer workflow, no additional setup
- **Cons**: Limited visualization capabilities, platform-specific
- **Technologies**: Terminal UI libraries, Warp block kit

### 4. Hybrid Approach

- **Pros**: Best of all worlds, user choice, gradual migration
- **Cons**: Complex architecture, maintenance overhead
- **Technologies**: Modular architecture with multiple frontends

### 5. Chat UI Integration Approach

- **Pros**: Natural language interaction, voice integration, unified interface
- **Cons**: AI integration complexity, potential latency issues
- **Technologies**: Chat UI components, AI API integration, voice processing
- **Shared Components**: Can be used by both web and mobile interfaces (Task #251)

## Backend Integration Strategy

### 1. Native Backend (JSON/File-based)

- Full control over data structure and features
- Direct integration with Minsky workflows
- Support for all planned features

### 2. GitHub Issues Integration

- Leverage existing GitHub workflow
- Support for labels, milestones, and assignees
- Limited by GitHub API constraints

### 3. Linear Integration

- Modern task management features
- Good API support
- Requires Linear subscription

### 4. Hybrid Backend

- Users can choose their preferred backend
- Synchronization between backends
- Unified interface regardless of backend choice

### 5. Chat UI Backend Integration

- **Shared Chat Service**: Common chat interface backend for both task management and voice interfaces
- **AI Integration**: Support for external AI services (OpenAI/Claude) with migration path to self-hosted
- **Migration Strategy**: Start with external services, provide option to transition to Minsky-controlled AI backend
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Backend designed to support web, mobile, and voice interfaces simultaneously

## User Experience Considerations

### 1. Task Spec Regeneration Workflow

- Support "user prompt causing regeneration of full task spec" flow
- Show diff between old and new specs
- Allow approval/rejection of changes
- Track regeneration history

### 2. Dependency Visualization

- Interactive graph with zoom and pan
- Different layout algorithms (hierarchical, force-directed, etc.)
- Color coding for task status
- Hover effects and tooltips

### 3. Session Management

- Show active sessions
- Display session history and branches
- Support session switching
- Visualize session-task relationships

### 4. Time-based Navigation

- Timeline view of task evolution
- Show "truncated subgraphs" when parent specs change
- Support for time-based filtering
- History and rollback capabilities

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Frontend Architecture

- Component-based design
- State management (Redux/Zustand)
- Routing and navigation
- Responsive design

### 2. Backend Architecture

- RESTful API design
- GraphQL for complex queries
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Database abstraction layer

### 3. Data Model

- Task entities with properties and relationships
- Session entities with task associations
- Dependency graph representation
- Version history tracking

### 4. Integration Layer

- Plugin architecture for different backends
- Unified API abstraction
- Data transformation and mapping
