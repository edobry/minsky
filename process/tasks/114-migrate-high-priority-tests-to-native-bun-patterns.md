# Migrate High-Priority Tests to Native Bun Patterns

## Context

Our test suite currently has 114 failing tests when run under Bun's test runner due to incompatibilities between Jest/Vitest mocking patterns and Bun's testing APIs. While the "Core Mock Compatibility Layer" task will provide short-term compatibility, we need to begin actively migrating critical tests to use native Bun patterns for long-term stability and performance.

This task focuses on identifying and migrating the highest-priority tests first, leveraging the insights from the "Test Inventory and Classification" task and the documentation from the "Test Utility Documentation" task. The priority will be determined by test criticality, frequency of execution, and complexity of migration.

This task should be executed AFTER the "Test Inventory and Classification" task, the "Core Mock Compatibility Layer" task, and the "Test Utility Documentation" task, as it depends on their outputs. It can be performed in parallel with the "Automated Test Migration Script" task, with manually migrated tests serving as examples for the automated tool.

## Final Project Summary (COMPLETED)

**SCOPE EXPANSION**: Original goal of 20 high-priority tests was exceeded with **26+ files** successfully migrated across multiple phases.

### Achievements

- **Total Tests Migrated:** 26+ files (130% of original goal)
- **Phases Completed:** 4 comprehensive phases
  - Phase 1: Original 20 high-priority tests (COMPLETED)
  - Phase 2A: Refactoring existing migrations (COMPLETED)
  - Phase 2B: Quick wins (COMPLETED)
  - Phase 2C: High business value tests (COMPLETED)
  - Phase 2D: Infrastructure tests (COMPLETED)
- **Custom Assertion Helpers:** 9 helpers created in `src/utils/test-utils/assertions.ts`
- **Migration Success Rate:** 100% - All targeted files successfully migrated
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive migration notes, patterns, and analysis

### Key Migration Patterns Established

1. **TypeScript Extensions:** Use `.ts` extensions with `allowImportingTsExtensions: true`
2. **Project Utilities:** Consistent use of `createMock()`, `setupTestMocks()`, custom assertions
3. **Migration Annotations:** All files marked with `@migrated` and `@refactored` tags
4. **Lifecycle Management:** Automatic cleanup via `setupTestMocks()`
5. **Error Handling:** Try/catch blocks with custom assertions for error type testing
6. **Complex Mocking:** Advanced patterns documented for future infrastructure improvements

### Files Migrated by Phase

**Phase 1 (Original Goal - 20 files):**

- All high-priority domain and utility tests
- Integration tests and CLI tests
- Core workflow functionality tests

**Phase 2A (Refactoring - 6 files):**

- Enhanced already-migrated files to use project utilities consistently
- Fixed TypeScript configuration issues
- Improved test patterns

**Phase 2B (Quick Wins - 3 files):**

- Git service task status updates
- Git default branch handling
- Session adapter tests

**Phase 2C (High Business Value - 3 files):**

- Git PR workflow tests
- Repository URI tests
- Session update tests

**Phase 2D (Infrastructure - 3 files):**

- GitHub backend tests
- MCP tasks integration tests
- MCP rules adapter tests (with advanced mocking documentation)
