# Add metadata support to tasks (subtasks, priority, dependencies)

## Status

BACKLOG

## Priority

MEDIUM

## Description

Explore adding metadata fields to tasks such as subtasks, priority, dependencies, and other extended task properties. Research how this would interact with different task backends - some have native support (GitHub issues) while others don't (markdown files). Model different architectural approaches: 1) Backend capabilities system, 2) SQL database simulation layer, 3) Feature disabling per backend. Include comprehensive tradeoff analysis and implementation recommendations.

## Requirements

### 1. Research and Analysis

#### 1.1 Task Metadata Survey

- [ ] Research common task metadata fields across different project management systems
- [ ] Identify core metadata categories:
  - **Structural**: subtasks, parent tasks, dependencies, blockers
  - **Organizational**: priority, tags, categories, milestones
  - **Temporal**: due dates, estimates, time tracking
  - **Workflow**: assignees, reviewers, status transitions
  - **Contextual**: descriptions, attachments, comments, links

#### 1.2 Backend Capabilities Analysis

- [ ] Analyze existing task backends and their native capabilities:
  - **GitHub Issues**: labels, milestones, assignees, linked issues, projects
  - **Markdown Files**: limited to file content and frontmatter
  - **JSON Files**: flexible schema support
  - **Future backends**: Linear, Jira, Notion, etc.
- [ ] Document capability matrix showing what each backend supports natively
- [ ] Identify capability gaps and overlaps

### 2. Architectural Design

#### 2.1 Approach 1: Backend Capabilities System

#### 2.2 Approach 2: SQL Database Simulation Layer

- [ ] Design a metadata storage layer using SQL database
- [ ] Model relationship between core task data and extended metadata

- [ ] Design visualization for task relationships
- [ ] Consider different user workflows

#### 4.3 Testing Strategy

- [ ] Design testing approach for multiple backends
- [ ] Consider integration testing with external systems
- [ ] Design performance testing for complex queries

### 5. Tradeoff Analysis

#### 5.1 Complexity Analysis

- [ ] Analyze implementation complexity for each approach
- [ ] Consider maintenance overhead
- [ ] Evaluate learning curve for developers and users

#### 5.2 Performance Analysis

- [ ] Analyze query performance implications
- [ ] Consider storage overhead
