# Task Metadata Architecture Research and Design

## Status

BACKLOG

## Priority

HIGH

## Description

Research and design the architectural foundation for task metadata systems including subtasks, priority, dependencies, and other extended task properties. This task focuses on architectural decision-making and provides the foundation for subsequent implementation tasks. The research will analyze how metadata interacts with different task backends and recommend the optimal architectural approach.

## Scope

**This task is RESEARCH AND ARCHITECTURE ONLY** - no implementation. Implementation will be handled by subsequent tasks based on the architectural decisions made here.

## Requirements

### 1. Research and Analysis

#### 1.1 Task Metadata Survey

- [ ] Research common task metadata fields across different project management systems
- [ ] Identify core metadata categories:
  - **Structural**: subtasks, parent tasks, dependencies, blockers
  - **Organizational**: priority, tags, categories, milestones
  - **Temporal**: due dates, estimates, time tracking
  - **Workflow**: assignees, reviewers, status transitions
  - **Contextual**: descriptions, attachments, comments, links

#### 1.2 Backend Capabilities Analysis

- [ ] Analyze existing task backends and their native capabilities:
  - **GitHub Issues**: labels, milestones, assignees, linked issues, projects
  - **Markdown Files**: limited to file content and frontmatter
  - **JSON Files**: flexible schema support
  - **Future backends**: Linear, Jira, Notion, etc.
- [ ] Document capability matrix showing what each backend supports natively
- [ ] Identify capability gaps and overlaps

### 2. Architectural Design

#### 2.1 Approach 1: Backend Capabilities System

- [ ] Design a capabilities registry system
- [ ] Model how features are enabled/disabled based on backend capabilities
- [ ] Design graceful degradation for unsupported features
- [ ] Consider API design for capability-aware operations

#### 2.2 Approach 2: SQL Database Simulation Layer

- [ ] Design a metadata storage layer using SQL database
- [ ] Model relationship between core task data and extended metadata
- [ ] Design synchronization mechanisms between backends and metadata DB
- [ ] Consider data consistency and conflict resolution

#### 2.3 Approach 3: Feature Disabling per Backend

- [ ] Design feature flags and conditional UI/API behavior
- [ ] Model user experience when features are unavailable
- [ ] Consider migration paths when switching backends

#### 2.4 Hybrid Approaches

- [ ] Explore combinations of the above approaches
- [ ] Design fallback mechanisms and progressive enhancement
- [ ] Consider backend-specific optimizations

### 3. Architectural Decision

#### 3.1 Tradeoff Analysis

- [ ] Analyze implementation complexity for each approach
- [ ] Consider maintenance overhead and performance implications
- [ ] Evaluate extensibility and future backend integration requirements
- [ ] Assess migration complexity between approaches

#### 3.2 Recommendation

- [ ] Select recommended architectural approach with detailed rationale
- [ ] Document architectural principles and constraints
- [ ] Create implementation guidelines for subsequent tasks

### 4. Implementation Planning

#### 4.1 Implementation Roadmap

- [ ] Create phased implementation plan based on chosen architecture
- [ ] Define clear interfaces between research and implementation phases
- [ ] Identify implementation tasks and their dependencies
- [ ] Establish success criteria for each implementation phase

#### 4.2 Risk Assessment

- [ ] Identify technical and project risks
- [ ] Define mitigation strategies
- [ ] Plan fallback options if chosen approach proves problematic

## Success Criteria

### 1. Comprehensive Analysis Document

- [ ] Complete research document covering all major project management systems
- [ ] Backend capability matrix with detailed feature comparison
- [ ] Clear identification of core vs. extended metadata categories

### 2. Architectural Decision

- [ ] **Clear architectural recommendation with detailed rationale**
- [ ] **Comprehensive tradeoff analysis with scoring matrix**
- [ ] **Architectural principles and implementation guidelines**
- [ ] **Detailed implementation roadmap with phases and dependencies**

### 3. Foundation for Implementation

- [ ] **Clear interfaces defined for implementation tasks**
- [ ] **Success criteria established for each implementation phase**
- [ ] **Risk assessment and mitigation strategies documented**

## Dependencies

- Understanding of current task backend architecture
- Access to various project management systems for research
- Stakeholder input on priority metadata fields
- Technical review from architecture team

## Deliverables

1. **Task Metadata Research Report** - comprehensive analysis of existing systems
2. **Backend Capability Matrix** - detailed comparison of backend capabilities
3. **Architectural Decision Document** - chosen approach with rationale
4. **Implementation Roadmap** - phased plan for subsequent implementation tasks
5. **Risk Assessment Report** - identified risks and mitigation strategies

## Related Implementation Tasks

The following tasks will implement the architecture decisions made in this task:

- **Task #246**: Implement Basic Task Parent-Child Relationships
- **Task #247**: Implement Task Hierarchy System (Parent-Child Relationships)
- **Task #248**: Add AI-powered task decomposition and analysis

**These implementation tasks MUST wait for the architectural decisions from this task before proceeding.**
