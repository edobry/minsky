# Prepare for Future Non-Filesystem Workspaces

## Context

The current Minsky implementation assumes that workspaces exist as directories in the local filesystem. While this is sufficient for current needs, future enhancements might require supporting non-filesystem workspaces, especially in containerized or remote environments. Task #080 identified the need to lay groundwork for this future capability while maintaining the current filesystem-based implementation.

## Requirements

1. **Extension Points**

   - Identify points in the codebase where abstractions would be needed for non-filesystem workspaces
   - Add necessary interfaces and abstract classes to support future implementations
   - Ensure the current implementation doesn't prevent future enhancements

2. **Design Documentation**

   - Document considerations for non-filesystem workspaces
   - Create architecture diagrams showing how non-filesystem workspaces could be integrated
   - Document potential use cases and implementation approaches

3. **Forward Compatibility**
   - Ensure any new code related to workspaces can support future non-filesystem implementations
   - Add appropriate type definitions that don't assume filesystem paths
   - Document compatibility considerations for future implementations

## Implementation Steps

1. [ ] Analyze current workspace interactions:

   - [ ] Identify all code that assumes filesystem-based workspaces
   - [ ] Categorize interactions by type (read, write, execute, etc.)
   - [ ] Document findings in a design document

2. [ ] Design abstraction layer:

   - [ ] Create interfaces for workspace operations
   - [ ] Design factory pattern for workspace implementations
   - [ ] Document design decisions and rationale

3. [ ] Implement minimal changes:

   - [ ] Add appropriate interfaces and abstract classes
   - [ ] Implement the filesystem workspace as concrete implementation
   - [ ] Ensure changes don't break existing functionality

4. [ ] Create design document:
   - [ ] Document proposed architecture for non-filesystem workspaces
   - [ ] Include examples of potential implementations
   - [ ] Address migration considerations

## Verification

- [ ] Current functionality is unchanged
- [ ] Design document clearly explains non-filesystem workspace approach
- [ ] Extension points are properly documented
- [ ] Architecture diagrams show how non-filesystem workspaces could be implemented
- [ ] Code comments indicate where future extensions would be needed
