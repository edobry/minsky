# Task 171: Analyze and Modularize Overly Long Files

## Overview

Investigate files exceeding 400 lines, analyze their structure and purpose, and develop strategies to break them up into smaller, more maintainable modules.

## Background

Large files (>400 lines) can become difficult to maintain, understand, and test. This task aims to:

1. Identify files that exceed the 400-line guideline
2. Analyze why these files are large and their internal structure
3. Develop modularization strategies
4. Implement refactoring to improve code organization

## Phase 1: Discovery and Analysis

### 1. File Size Audit

- [ ] Scan codebase for files >400 lines
- [ ] Generate file size report with line counts
- [ ] Categorize files by type (domain logic, utilities, adapters, etc.)
- [ ] Prioritize files by size and complexity

### 2. Structural Analysis

For each large file, analyze:

- [ ] **Primary responsibilities**: What is the main purpose?
- [ ] **Secondary responsibilities**: What additional concerns are handled?
- [ ] **Cohesion**: How related are the different parts?
- [ ] **Dependencies**: What external modules are imported?
- [ ] **Exports**: What functionality is exposed?
- [ ] **Internal structure**: Classes, functions, interfaces, types

### 3. Complexity Assessment

- [ ] **Cyclomatic complexity**: Measure decision points and branches
- [ ] **Coupling**: Analyze dependencies between different sections
- [ ] **Single Responsibility Principle**: Identify violations
- [ ] **Code duplication**: Look for repeated patterns
- [ ] **Test coverage**: Assess testing complexity

## Phase 2: Modularization Strategy

### 1. Identify Extraction Opportunities

- [ ] **Utility functions**: Extract pure functions and helpers
- [ ] **Type definitions**: Move interfaces and types to dedicated files
- [ ] **Constants**: Extract configuration and constant values
- [ ] **Subdomain logic**: Identify cohesive business logic groups
- [ ] **Adapter patterns**: Separate interface implementations

### 2. Design Module Boundaries

- [ ] **Domain-oriented modules**: Group by business capability
- [ ] **Layer separation**: Separate concerns (data, logic, presentation)
- [ ] **Interface segregation**: Create focused, minimal interfaces
- [ ] **Dependency direction**: Ensure proper dependency flow

### 3. Refactoring Approach

- [ ] **Extract Method**: Break down large functions
- [ ] **Extract Class**: Separate distinct responsibilities
- [ ] **Extract Module**: Move related functionality to new files
- [ ] **Extract Interface**: Define clear contracts
- [ ] **Move Function**: Relocate functions to appropriate modules

## Phase 3: Implementation

### 1. High-Priority Files

Focus on files that are:

- [ ] Frequently modified (high change frequency)
- [ ] Critical to system functionality
- [ ] Difficult to test due to size
- [ ] Sources of bugs or maintenance issues

### 2. Modularization Execution

- [ ] Create new module files with clear naming
- [ ] Move related functionality together
- [ ] Update import/export statements
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility where needed
- [ ] Update tests to reflect new structure

### 3. Documentation Updates

- [ ] Update module documentation
- [ ] Create architectural decision records (ADRs)
- [ ] Update code organization guidelines
- [ ] Document new module boundaries

## Phase 4: Validation

### 1. Quality Assurance

- [ ] Verify all tests still pass
- [ ] Check for no functional regressions
- [ ] Validate import/export correctness
- [ ] Ensure type safety is maintained

### 2. Metrics Improvement

- [ ] Measure reduction in file sizes
- [ ] Assess improvement in cohesion metrics
- [ ] Validate reduced coupling between modules
- [ ] Check test coverage maintenance

### 3. Developer Experience

- [ ] Easier navigation and code discovery
- [ ] Improved IDE performance and suggestions
- [ ] Faster build times (if applicable)
- [ ] Better code review experience

## Specific Analysis Areas

### 1. Domain Logic Files

- Session management (`session.ts`)
- Git operations (`git.ts`)
- Task management (`taskService.ts`, `taskCommands.ts`)
- Repository handling (`repository.ts`)

### 2. Adapter Files

- CLI command implementations
- MCP tool implementations
- Backend adapters

### 3. Utility and Helper Files

- Logger implementations
- Error handling utilities
- Configuration management

## Success Criteria

- [ ] No files exceed 400 lines (with documented exceptions)
- [ ] Improved code cohesion and reduced coupling
- [ ] Clearer module boundaries and responsibilities
- [ ] Maintained or improved test coverage
- [ ] No functional regressions
- [ ] Improved developer experience and code navigation
- [ ] Documentation of new module structure

## Priority

Medium-High

## Estimated Effort

6-10 hours

## Notes

- Consider creating a "before and after" comparison
- Document any exceptions to the 400-line rule with justification
- Ensure refactoring follows existing architectural patterns
- Maintain consistency with domain-oriented module guidelines
