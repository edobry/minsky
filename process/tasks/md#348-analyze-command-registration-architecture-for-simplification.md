# Analyze Command Registration Architecture for Simplification

## Context

The current command registration system has grown complex over time and may benefit from analysis to identify opportunities for simplification and improved maintainability.

## Problem

- Command registration architecture may have accumulated complexity
- Potential for simplification exists
- Need to analyze current patterns and identify improvements

## Requirements

1. **Analyze current command registration patterns**
2. **Identify areas of complexity** that could be simplified
3. **Propose architectural improvements**
4. **Document findings and recommendations**

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete analysis of command registration system
- [ ] Document areas for simplification
- [ ] Propose specific improvements
- [ ] Create implementation plan if warranted

## Status

TODO - Analysis not yet started
