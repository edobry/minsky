# Analyze Command Registration Architecture for Simplification

## Context

The command registration system has grown in complexity and needs analysis to identify opportunities for simplification and improved maintainability.

## Problem

- Command registration architecture may have accumulated technical debt
- Multiple patterns and approaches exist that could be consolidated
- Need systematic analysis to identify simplification opportunities

## Requirements

1. **Analyze current command registration patterns** across the codebase
2. **Identify areas of complexity** that could be simplified
3. **Document findings** with specific recommendations
4. **Propose architectural improvements** for better maintainability

## Implementation Notes

Evidence shows this task had substantial work done, including:
- `fix-command-registration-overloads.ts` implementations across multiple sessions
- Focus on command registration architecture analysis
- Work on simplifying registration patterns

## Status

TODO - Analysis and documentation phase

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete analysis of current command registration system
- [ ] Document complexity areas and improvement opportunities  
- [ ] Propose specific architectural simplifications
- [ ] Create implementation roadmap if warranted
