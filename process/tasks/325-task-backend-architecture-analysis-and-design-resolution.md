# Task Backend Architecture Analysis and Design Resolution

## Problem Statement

The current task system architecture faces a fundamental tension between supporting in-tree task metadata backends (markdown/json) and managing the resulting workflow complexity. The special workspace mechanism designed to support in-tree backends has proven complex, brittle, and possibly more trouble than it's worth. This task involves a comprehensive analysis of the architectural tradeoffs and philosophical considerations to resolve the core design questions around task backend architecture.

## Core Architectural Conflict

### The Central Dilemma

Supporting in-tree task metadata backends (markdown/json files stored in the repository) requires complex synchronization mechanisms, currently implemented through the "special workspace" workflow. This creates several layers of complexity:

1. **Synchronization Complexity**: Task management operations must happen on `main` for in-tree backends, requiring careful coordination
2. **Special Workspace Overhead**: The current approach requires maintaining a separate workspace and complex synchronization logic
3. **Distributed Team Challenges**: In team environments without a centralized "main workspace," the complexity multiplies
4. **Database Reimplementation**: The current approach essentially reimplements transactional database features on top of git

### Philosophical vs Practical Considerations

The in-tree approach offers philosophical elegance:
- **Dependency-free**: No external infrastructure required
- **Git-native**: Task state follows git history naturally
- **Branch-aligned**: Task metadata lives on its associated session/branch
- **Self-contained**: Everything needed is in the repository

However, practical needs suggest database backends:
- **Single pane of glass**: View entire task graph without traversing sessions
- **Real-time updates**: See latest task status across all branches
- **Team coordination**: Centralized task state for distributed teams
- **Performance**: Efficient querying and updates at scale

## Key Architectural Questions

### 1. Task State Location Philosophy

**Branch-local vs Centralized State**
- Should task metadata live exclusively on its associated session/branch?
- Or does the need for cross-branch visibility require centralized storage?
- Can we achieve both through clever architecture?

### 2. Task Status Derivation

**Explicit vs Implicit Status**
- Is explicit task status (TODO, IN-PROGRESS, etc.) necessary?
- Can status be derived from git state alone?
  - Session exists → IN-PROGRESS
  - PR open → IN-REVIEW
  - PR merged → DONE
  - Branch deleted → CLOSED
- What about BLOCKED, BACKLOG, and other statuses?

### 3. Task Graph and User Interaction Model

**Session-centric vs Task-centric Workflows**
- How do users interact with the task graph when nodes span multiple sessions?
- How do AI-generated subtasks relate to user prompts and interventions?
- Can users pre-empt/intervene at any subnode without session complexity?

### 4. Synchronization Architecture

**Git-based vs Database-based Coordination**
- Is git sufficient for coordinating task operations?
- At what point does git-based coordination become "reimplementing a database"?
- Should we embrace existing solutions (like Dolt) instead?

## Research Areas

#### Migration Strategies
- How to transition from in-tree to database backends
- Supporting both simultaneously
- Data consistency during transition
- Preserving git history

### 3. Workflow Impact Analysis

#### User Workflows
- **Individual developers**: Simple, dependency-free setup
- **Small teams**: Minimal infrastructure, easy coordination
- **Large teams**: Scalable, performant, feature-rich
- **Open source projects**: Fork-friendly, contribution-friendly

#### Task Management Operations
- Creating tasks
- Updating status
- Viewing task graphs
- AI decomposition and intervention
- Cross-session task relationships

### 4. Philosophical Framework

#### Core Design Principles
- What are Minsky's fundamental values?
- How do we balance elegance with practicality?
- What tradeoffs are we willing to make?
- What is our primary user persona?

#### Architectural Coherence
- How does task backend choice affect overall system design?
- What are the ripple effects of each approach?
- How do we maintain conceptual integrity?
