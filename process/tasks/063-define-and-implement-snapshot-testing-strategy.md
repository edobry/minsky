# Task #063: Define and Implement Snapshot Testing Strategy

## Context
While explicit assertions are preferred, snapshot testing can be valuable for verifying complex output structures or UI components. We need a clear strategy for when and how to use snapshot tests with bun:test to ensure they are maintainable and provide meaningful value.

## Requirements
- Define guidelines for when snapshot tests are appropriate (e.g., complex outputs, UI components).
- Document how to implement snapshot tests using bun:test (`toMatchSnapshot`, `toMatchInlineSnapshot`).
- Provide guidance on updating snapshots (`bun test --update-snapshots`).
- Recommend best practices for snapshot test structure and naming.
- Address potential pitfalls of snapshot testing (e.g., over-reliance, large snapshots).

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Research bun:test's snapshot testing features.
- [ ] Draft guidelines for appropriate snapshot test usage.
- [ ] Document implementation details (`toMatchSnapshot`, `toMatchInlineSnapshot`).
- [ ] Add guidance on updating snapshots.
- [ ] Create a simple example test file demonstrating snapshot testing.
- [ ] Update documentation (potentially within `framework-specific-tests.mdc` or a new rule).

## Verification
- [ ] The team has clear guidance on using snapshot tests.
- [ ] New snapshot tests follow the defined strategy.
- [ ] Snapshots are updated deliberately and reviewed in PRs.
