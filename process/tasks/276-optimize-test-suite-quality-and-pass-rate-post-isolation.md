- [ ] Ensure proper cleanup and isolation patterns are applied consistently

### 5. **Integration Test Pattern Application**
**Goal**: Apply withTestIsolation() patterns to tests/ directory
- [ ] Identify integration tests in `tests/` directory lacking isolation patterns
- [ ] Apply `withTestIsolation()` pattern from Task #269 cleanup utilities
- [ ] Ensure integration tests use proper cleanup patterns:
  - Unique temporary directories with timestamp + UUID

<<<<<<< HEAD
### 3. **Systematic Failure Categorization**
**Goal**: Categorize the 154 remaining test failures by root cause
- [x] Run test suite and capture detailed failure output

- [x] Prioritize categories by impact and fix difficulty
- [ ] Create targeted fixes for each category

## Detailed Failure Analysis

### 1. Import/Module Resolution Errors (22 failures) - HIGH PRIORITY
**Root Cause**: Test suite reorganization broke import paths

**Critical Files Requiring Import Path Fixes:**
- `src/domain/session/session-context-resolver.test.ts` - Cannot find module '../session-context-resolver.js'
- `tests/adapters/mcp/session-edit-tools.test.ts` - Cannot find module '../session-edit-tools'
- `tests/adapters/mcp/session-workspace.test.ts` - Cannot find module '../session-workspace'
- `tests/adapters/cli/cli-rules-integration.test.ts` - Cannot find module '../../../utils/rules-helpers.js'
- `tests/adapters/cli/integration-example.test.ts` - Cannot find module '../../../adapters/cli/integration-example.js'
- `tests/adapters/cli/rules-helpers.test.ts` - Cannot find module '../../../utils/rules-helpers.js'
- `tests/adapters/cli/session.test.ts` - Cannot find module '../../../domain/session.js'
- `tests/adapters/cli/integration-simplified.test.ts` - Cannot find module '../../../adapters/shared/command-registry.js'
- `adapters/shared/commands/tests/tasks-status-selector.test.ts` - Cannot find module '../../../../domain/tasks/taskConstants'
- `adapters/shared/commands/tests/sessiondb.test.ts` - Cannot find module '../sessiondb'

**Impact**: Blocking basic test execution - these tests cannot run at all

### 2. Variable Definition Errors (19 failures) - CURRENT FOCUS
**Root Cause**: Variable naming mismatches and undefined variables

**Common Patterns:**
- `ReferenceError: e is not defined` - Missing variable captures in catch blocks
- `ReferenceError: mockExecAsync is not defined` - Missing mock variable declarations
- Variable declaration vs usage mismatches from underscore naming issues

**Affected Files:**
- `src/domain/__tests__/tasks.test.ts` - Multiple undefined variable references
- `tests/domain/commands/workspace.commands.test.ts` - mockExecAsync undefined issues
- `src/domain/session/session-db-io.test.ts` - async/await syntax errors

**Current Status**: In Progress - Systematic variable definition fixes being applied

### 3. Test Logic and Assertion Issues (45 failures) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Root Cause**: Incorrect test expectations and logic errors

**Common Issues:**
- Property mismatches: `_session` vs `session` vs `gitRoot`
- Wrong expected values in assertions
- Missing async/await in test functions
- Test expectations not matching actual behavior

**Examples:**
- SessionAdapter tests expecting `_session` but getting `session`
- Path assertion failures expecting different directory structures
- ConflictDetectionService tests with incorrect expected values

### 4. Type Validation and Casting Issues (18 failures) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Root Cause**: Zod validation failures and type casting problems

**Examples:**
- `ValidationError: Invalid parameters for getting task status`
- `ZodError: Task ID must be in format #TEST_VALUE or TEST_VALUE`
- Type casting issues with `as unknown` patterns from recent type safety improvements

### 5. Mock and Test Infrastructure Issues (21 failures) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Root Cause**: Mock setup problems and test infrastructure

**Examples:**
- Mock functions not being called as expected
- Test isolation setup issues
- Configuration problems in test environment

### 6. Performance and Integration Issues (29 failures) - LOW PRIORITY
**Root Cause**: Long-running tests and integration environment problems

**Examples:**
- Codemod tests taking 350ms+ (TypeScript Error Fixer)
- Integration tests failing due to environment setup
- Performance degradation in boundary validation tests

- [ ] All integration tests use proper cleanup patterns

## Dependencies

**Prerequisite**: Task #269 completion (✅ COMPLETED)
- Test isolation implementation must be complete
- Cleanup patterns and utilities must be available
- Working directory isolation must be implemented

**Required Tools**:
- `withTestIsolation()` utility from Task #269
- `TestIsolationManager` and cleanup patterns
- Configuration override system from Task #269

## Implementation Lessons Learned

### TypeScript Configuration Discovery
- **Discovery**: TypeScript configuration excluded test files, causing runtime-only import errors
- **Learning**: Test files must be included in TypeScript compilation for proper validation
- **Impact**: Fixed 59 "Cannot find module" errors by updating tsconfig.json
