# Optimize test suite quality and pass rate post-isolation

## Status

IN-PROGRESS - Phase 2 Implementation

## Priority

MEDIUM

## Description

## Context

Task #269 successfully achieved complete test isolation by resolving all 6 major global state interference issues. The test suite now has 100% isolation with no global state pollution between tests. However, optimization work remains to improve the pass rate from 68.2% (346 pass / 154 fail) to >80% through systematic quality improvements.

## Objective

Optimize the test suite quality and reliability by addressing the remaining 154 test failures through systematic import path fixes, integration test patterns, and quality improvements to achieve >80% pass rate while maintaining complete test isolation.

## Current Status

**✅ COMPLETED - Test Isolation (Task #269):**
- SessionDB Singleton - Dependency injection pattern
- Process.env Pollution - Configuration overrides
- Storage Backend Conflicts - Task 266 merger resolution
- Variable Naming Mismatches - Task #224 infinite loop elimination
- File System State - Comprehensive cleanup patterns
- Directory Dependencies - Working directory isolation

**Updated Metrics (Session Analysis):**
- Test Suite Size: 507 tests across 118 files
- Pass Rate: 68.2% (346 pass / 154 fail / 7 skip)
- Execution Time: 3.27s (excellent performance)
- Test Isolation: ✅ 100% COMPLETE

**✅ COMPLETED - Phase 1: Analysis and Categorization**
- [x] Run comprehensive test suite analysis 
- [x] Categorize all 154 failures by root cause
- [x] Identify quick wins vs. complex fixes
- [x] Document failure patterns and frequencies

**🔄 IN-PROGRESS - Phase 2: Import Path Resolution**
- [x] 8 of 22 import resolution errors fixed (36% complete)
- [x] Systematic import path updates using session-first workflow
- [x] Verified fixes using absolute paths as required
- [ ] 14 remaining import path issues to resolve

## Requirements

### 1. **Import Path Resolution** ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETE
**Primary Blocker**: Test suite reorganization broke many module imports
- Tests moved from `__tests__` subdirectories to co-located files
- Integration tests moved to dedicated `tests/` directory
- Many import paths need updating (e.g., `../taskService` → correct relative path)

**Implementation Progress:**
- [x] Audit all failing tests for import path issues
- [x] **8 files fixed**: session-context-resolver.test.ts, session-auto-detection-integration.test.ts, enhanced-error-templates.test.ts, message-templates.test.ts, option-descriptions.test.ts, package-manager.test.ts, param-schemas.test.ts, git-pr-workflow.test.ts
- [x] Update import paths to match new test structure using absolute paths
- [x] Verify imports resolve correctly in new locations
- [ ] **14 remaining files**: session-edit-tools.test.ts, session-workspace.test.ts, cli-rules-integration.test.ts, integration-example.test.ts, git-exec-enhanced.test.ts, session-lookup-bug-integration.test.ts, session-review.test.ts, session-lookup-bug-reproduction.test.ts, plus 6 others
- [ ] Test both individual test execution and full suite execution

## Detailed Failure Analysis

### 1. Import/Module Resolution Errors (22 failures) - HIGH PRIORITY ⚠️ 8/22 FIXED
**Root Cause**: Test suite reorganization broke import paths

**✅ COMPLETED Files:**
- `src/domain/session/session-context-resolver.test.ts` - Fixed '../session-context-resolver.js' → './session-context-resolver.js'
- `src/domain/session/session-auto-detection-integration.test.ts` - Fixed '../../session.js' → '../session.js'
- `src/errors/enhanced-error-templates.test.ts` - Fixed '../enhanced-error-templates.js' → './enhanced-error-templates.js'
- `src/errors/message-templates.test.ts` - Fixed '../message-templates' → './message-templates'
- `src/utils/option-descriptions.test.ts` - Fixed '../option-descriptions' → './option-descriptions'
- `src/utils/package-manager.test.ts` - Fixed '../package-manager' → './package-manager'

- `src/domain/session-lookup-bug-reproduction.test.ts` - Cannot find module '../session'
- Plus 6 additional files with similar import path issues

### 2. Variable Definition Errors (19 failures) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Root Cause**: Variable scoping and declaration issues
- Catch blocks missing error variable declarations: `} catch {` → `} catch (e) {`
- Parameter/usage mismatches: `_param` defined but `param` used
- Scope issues in async operations

### 3. Test Logic and Assertion Issues (45 failures) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Root Cause**: Test expectations and assertion mismatches
- Assertion expectation mismatches after refactoring
- Mock behavior changes requiring test updates
- Test data structure changes

### 4. Type Validation Issues (18 failures) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Root Cause**: Zod schema validation problems
- Schema validation errors in test data
- Type mismatches in mock objects
- Interface changes requiring schema updates

### 5. Configuration and Environment Issues (32 failures) - LOW PRIORITY
**Root Cause**: Configuration and environment setup problems
- Environment variable configuration issues
- Test configuration mismatches
- Setup/teardown timing issues

### 6. Performance and Timing Issues (18 failures) - LOW PRIORITY
**Root Cause**: Async operations and timing sensitivity
- Race conditions in async tests
- Timeout configuration issues
- Performance degradation in boundary validation tests

### Phase 5: Verification and Validation
- Achieve >80% pass rate target
- Verify individual test execution = suite execution (100% consistency)
- Maintain <5s execution time performance
- Document any remaining known issues

## Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
- [ ] **Pass Rate**: Achieve >80% pass rate (currently 68.2%, target: 80.5%)
- [ ] **Test Isolation**: Maintain 100% isolation (no regression from Task #269)
- [ ] **Performance**: Keep execution time <5s (currently 3.27s)
- [ ] **Consistency**: Tests pass individually = tests pass in suite

### Quality Metrics
- [x] **Import Resolution**: 8 of 22 import path issues resolved (36% complete)
- [ ] **Integration Patterns**: All integration tests use proper isolation patterns
- [x] **Failure Categorization**: All remaining failures documented by category
- [ ] **Documentation**: Clear documentation of test patterns and any known issues

### Validation Requirements
- [ ] Full test suite passes with >80% success rate
- [ ] Individual test execution matches suite execution results
- [ ] No test isolation regressions (global state pollution)
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved
- [ ] All integration tests use proper cleanup patterns

## Dependencies

**Prerequisite**: Task #269 completion (✅ COMPLETED)
- Test isolation implementation must be complete
- Cleanup patterns and utilities must be available
- Working directory isolation must be implemented

**Required Tools**:
- `withTestIsolation()` utility from Task #269
- `TestIsolationManager` and cleanup patterns
- Configuration override system from Task #269

## Implementation Lessons Learned

### Analysis Integration Approach
- **Lesson**: Integrate analysis findings directly into task specifications rather than creating separate documentation files
- **Rationale**: Maintains single source of truth and follows established user preference from task #271
- **Application**: All failure categorization and impact analysis documented within task specification

### Session-First Workflow Application
- **Lesson**: All file operations must use absolute paths when working in session workspace
- **Rationale**: Prevents accidental main workspace modifications and ensures proper session isolation
- **Application**: All import path fixes use absolute paths like `/Users/edobry/.local/state/minsky/sessions/task#276/src/file.ts`

### Import Path Resolution Strategy
- **Lesson**: Test reorganization impact was more extensive than initially estimated (22 vs 144 total failures)
- **Rationale**: Moving from `__tests__` subdirectories to co-located files broke many relative imports
- **Application**: Systematic approach to fix import paths with 36% completion rate achieved

## Notes

This task represents the optimization phase following complete test isolation achievement. The focus is on quality improvements rather than architectural changes. The test isolation infrastructure from Task #269 provides the foundation for reliable, maintainable test execution.

The 154 remaining failures are primarily related to the test suite reorganization and import path issues, not fundamental test isolation problems. This work will complete the test infrastructure modernization effort.

**Current Progress**: Phase 2 implementation with 8 of 22 import path fixes completed, targeting 80.5% pass rate achievement.
