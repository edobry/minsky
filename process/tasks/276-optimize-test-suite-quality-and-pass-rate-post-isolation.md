## Status

**🔄 IN PROGRESS - Phase 11 (Post-Merge Analysis & Test Recovery)**

**CURRENT STATUS: Post-Merge Analysis Required** ⏳ **MAIN BRANCH INTEGRATED**
- ✅ **Main branch merge completed** - All conflicts resolved successfully
- ⏳ **Test status assessment pending** - Need to determine post-merge pass rate
- 🔧 **Previous baseline**: 87.7% pass rate (540 pass / 60 fail / 22 errors)
- 🎯 **TARGET: 100% pass rate - ALL TESTS MUST PASS**
- 📋 **Next Step**: Run full test suite to assess post-merge impact

**✅ COMPLETED - Phase 10B (Main Branch Merge Integration):**
- ✅ **Main branch merge completed successfully** - Commit: `572b61cf`
- ✅ **6 merge conflicts resolved** - All integration issues addressed systematically
- ✅ **Session command updates** - Function names updated: inspectSessionFromParams → sessionInspect, listSessionsFromParams → sessionList
- ✅ **TaskService interface preserved** - Maintained getTaskStatus & setTaskStatus method compatibility
- ✅ **Test utility formatting fixed** - Resolved indentation and conditional formatting issues
- ✅ **Remote synchronization complete** - Changes pushed to origin/task#276

**📋 MERGE CONFLICTS RESOLVED:**
1. **src/domain/session.ts** - Took main version (complete rewrite from upstream)
2. **src/domain/tasks/taskService.ts** - Integrated both changes preserving interface compatibility
3. **src/domain/session/commands/inspect-command.ts** - Updated to new function naming convention
4. **src/domain/session/commands/list-command.ts** - Updated to new function naming convention  
5. **src/utils/test-helpers.ts** - Fixed formatting and indentation issues
6. **src/utils/test-utils.ts** - Removed unnecessary conditional checks

**✅ PREVIOUS PROGRESS ACHIEVED:**
- **TypeScript Error Fixer framework integration working** - tests improving
- **Codemod framework properly integrated** - file saves and changes tracked correctly
- **Test expectations partially updated** - demonstrating systematic improvement approach

**🔍 INVESTIGATION FINDINGS:**

**🔍 NEXT PHASE - Phase 11 Priority Actions (Post-Merge Analysis):**
1. **Post-Merge Test Assessment**: Run full test suite to determine current pass rate after main branch integration
2. **Identify Merge-Introduced Issues**: Analyze any new test failures caused by main branch changes
3. **Test Regression Analysis**: Compare pre-merge vs post-merge test results to isolate impact
4. **Resume Systematic Framework Integration**: Continue proven pattern of framework integration → test expectation updates
5. **Module Instantiation Error Resolution**: Address remaining "Requested module is not instantiated yet" errors

**🔍 COMPLETED - Phase 10B (Individual Test Verification & Main Branch Merge):**
- ✅ **SQLite tests**: 24/24 pass individually (fail in full suite)
- ✅ **Git import tests**: 4/4 pass individually (fail in full suite) 
- ✅ **TaskBackendRouter tests**: 16/16 pass individually (fail in full suite)
- ✅ **Pattern identified**: ALL major failing test groups pass when run in isolation

**📊 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**
- **Individual Tests**: Work perfectly - all major groups pass 100% when isolated
- **Full Suite**: Same tests fail due to test isolation breakdown 
- **Module Loading Issues**: "Requested module is not instantiated yet" errors indicate async timing problems
- **Suite-Level Contamination**: Tests interfere with each other in full suite execution

**USER REQUIREMENT CLARIFICATION**: "ALL TESTS TO PASS, NO EXCEPTIONS" - 100% pass rate required, not 87.3%

**✅ COMPLETED - Phase 9 (Infrastructure Test Cleanup):**
- ✅ Renamed git-exec-enhanced.ts → git-exec.ts (eliminated internal assessment language)

- ✅ Analysis showed git-exec provides command formatting, timeout detection, conflict parsing, error context
- ✅ Determined testing infrastructure wrappers by mocking their dependencies provides no value
- ✅ Removed git-exec.test.ts entirely - focus should be on testing business logic with git-exec mocked
- ✅ Applied correct testing philosophy: test business logic that depends on git-exec, not git-exec itself

**✅ COMPLETED - Session Workspace Infrastructure:**
- ✅ All work performed in session workspace using absolute paths
- ✅ Proper session-first-workflow adherence maintained

## Detailed Failure Analysis

### 1. Import/Module Resolution Errors (22 failures) - HIGH PRIORITY
**Root Cause**: Test suite reorganization broke import paths

**Critical Files Requiring Import Path Fixes:**
- `src/domain/session/session-context-resolver.test.ts` - Cannot find module '../session-context-resolver.js'
- `tests/adapters/mcp/session-edit-tools.test.ts` - Cannot find module '../session-edit-tools'
- `tests/adapters/mcp/session-workspace.test.ts` - Cannot find module '../session-workspace'
- `tests/adapters/cli/cli-rules-integration.test.ts` - Cannot find module '../../../utils/rules-helpers.js'
- `tests/adapters/cli/integration-example.test.ts` - Cannot find module '../../../adapters/cli/integration-example.js'
- `tests/adapters/cli/rules-helpers.test.ts` - Cannot find module '../../../utils/rules-helpers.js'
- `tests/adapters/cli/session.test.ts` - Cannot find module '../../../domain/session.js'
- `tests/adapters/cli/integration-simplified.test.ts` - Cannot find module '../../../adapters/shared/command-registry.js'
- `adapters/shared/commands/tests/tasks-status-selector.test.ts` - Cannot find module '../../../../domain/tasks/taskConstants'
- `adapters/shared/commands/tests/sessiondb.test.ts` - Cannot find module '../sessiondb'

**Impact**: Blocking basic test execution - these tests cannot run at all

### 2. Variable Definition Errors (19 failures) - CURRENT FOCUS
**Root Cause**: Variable naming mismatches and undefined variables

**Common Patterns:**
- `ReferenceError: e is not defined` - Missing variable captures in catch blocks
- `ReferenceError: mockExecAsync is not defined` - Missing mock variable declarations
- Variable declaration vs usage mismatches from underscore naming issues

**Affected Files:**
- `src/domain/__tests__/tasks.test.ts` - Multiple undefined variable references
- `tests/domain/commands/workspace.commands.test.ts` - mockExecAsync undefined issues
- `src/domain/session/session-db-io.test.ts` - async/await syntax errors

**Current Status**: In Progress - Systematic variable definition fixes being applied

### 3. Test Logic and Assertion Issues (45 failures) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Root Cause**: Incorrect test expectations and logic errors

**Common Issues:**
- Property mismatches: `_session` vs `session` vs `gitRoot`
- Wrong expected values in assertions
- Missing async/await in test functions
- Test expectations not matching actual behavior

**Examples:**
- SessionAdapter tests expecting `_session` but getting `session`
- Path assertion failures expecting different directory structures
- ConflictDetectionService tests with incorrect expected values

### 4. Type Validation and Casting Issues (18 failures) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Root Cause**: Zod validation failures and type casting problems

**Examples:**
- `ValidationError: Invalid parameters for getting task status`
- `ZodError: Task ID must be in format #TEST_VALUE or TEST_VALUE`
- Type casting issues with `as unknown` patterns from recent type safety improvements

### 5. Mock and Test Infrastructure Issues (21 failures) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Root Cause**: Mock setup problems and test infrastructure

**Examples:**
- Mock functions not being called as expected
- Test isolation setup issues
- Configuration problems in test environment

### 6. Performance and Integration Issues (29 failures) - LOW PRIORITY
**Root Cause**: Long-running tests and integration environment problems

**Examples:**
- Codemod tests taking 350ms+ (TypeScript Error Fixer)
- Integration tests failing due to environment setup
- Performance degradation in boundary validation tests

- [ ] Full test suite passes with >80% success rate
- [ ] Individual test execution matches suite execution results
- [ ] No test isolation regressions (global state pollution)
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved
- [ ] All integration tests use proper cleanup patterns

## Dependencies

**Prerequisite**: Task #269 completion (✅ COMPLETED)
- Test isolation implementation must be complete
- Cleanup patterns and utilities must be available
- Working directory isolation must be implemented

**Required Tools**:
- `withTestIsolation()` utility from Task #269
- `TestIsolationManager` and cleanup patterns
- Configuration override system from Task #269

## Implementation Lessons Learned

### TypeScript Configuration Discovery
- **Discovery**: TypeScript configuration excluded test files, causing runtime-only import errors
- **Learning**: Test files must be included in TypeScript compilation for proper validation
- **Impact**: Fixed 59 "Cannot find module" errors by updating tsconfig.json

### Session Path Behavior Changes
- **Discovery**: Session path behavior changed from "repo/sessions/session-name" to "/sessions/session-name"
- **Learning**: Test assertions must be updated to match current system behavior
- **Impact**: Fixed SessionAdapter test expectations and improved maintainability

### Test Isolation vs. Full Suite Execution
- **Discovery**: Tests passing individually but failing in full suite indicates deeper isolation issues
- **Learning**: Test isolation from Task #269 provides foundation but doesn't eliminate all contamination
- **Impact**: Requires systematic investigation of mock state and environment bleeding
