# Task #399: Create Comprehensive Integration Tests for session.edit_file MCP Tool with Cursor edit_file Parity Verification

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

## Objective

Create comprehensive integration tests for the `session.edit_file` MCP tool that:
1. ✅ Test various code-editing scenarios with sample code files
2. ✅ Include different types of edits with expected outcomes  
3. ✅ Use the real Morph API for edit pattern application
4. ✅ Are specifically invoked (not run on every test suite execution)
5. 🔍 **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Fix fundamental error handling bug in AI completion service

## Critical Bug Found

**During integration test development, we discovered a critical bug in the AI completion service:**

### Bug Description
The `DefaultAICompletionService` does not properly handle HTTP error responses from AI providers:
- **Rate limit responses (429)** are processed as successful content instead of throwing errors
- **Error response bodies** are returned as completion content
- **No proper retry logic** for transient failures
- **Silent failures** instead of proper error propagation

### Evidence
```
Original API Response: 429 Too Many Requests
Response Body: {"detail": "Rate limit exceeded..."}
Current Behavior: Returns error message as completion content (155 chars)
Expected Behavior: Should throw RateLimitError with retry logic
```

## Test-Driven Bugfix Approach

Following the test-driven bugfix methodology:

### Phase 1: Reproduce the Bug with Failing Tests ✅

1. **Write failing tests** that demonstrate the error handling bug
2. **Mock API responses** for various error scenarios (429, 401, 500, etc.)
3. **Document expected vs actual behavior** in test comments
4. **Verify tests fail** as expected before implementing fixes

### Phase 2: Fix the Implementation

1. **Implement proper HTTP status code detection** in completion service
2. **Add appropriate error types** for different failure modes
3. **Implement retry logic** with exponential backoff for rate limits
4. **Ensure proper error propagation** to session.edit_file

### Phase 3: Verify and Integrate

1. **Ensure all tests pass** after implementing fixes
2. **Test session.edit_file integration** with proper error handling
3. **Verify edit pattern functionality** works correctly with valid responses

## Real Integration Requirements

- ✅ **Real Configuration System**: Load Morph API token from `.minskyrc`
- ✅ **Real HTTP Requests**: Actual calls to `https://api.morphllm.com/v1/chat/completions`
- 🔍 **Proper Error Handling**: Handle rate limits, auth errors, and failures correctly
- ✅ **Comprehensive Logging**: Full request/response details for debugging
- ✅ **Specific Invocation**: `FORCE_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1 bun test integration/`
