## Description

## Context and Background

This task continues the work from **Task #178 Phase 6: AST-Only Modular Framework Development** where we successfully:

1. **Eliminated dangerous pattern-based codemods** that created invalid syntax
2. **Built AST-only modular framework** with `CodemodFramework` supporting only TypeScript AST transforms
3. **Achieved 8/9 test success rate** with comprehensive safety mechanisms
4. **Established proper test organization** with co-located tests and specific naming

**Current Framework Status:**
- **100% AST-based** - No pattern-based functionality remains
- **Safety-first design** - Framework prevents dangerous operations by design
- **Modular architecture** - Reusable transforms and utilities
- **One remaining issue** - AST node invalidation in optional chaining transform

- Modular framework approach enables reusable, testable, maintainable codemods
- User feedback drives architectural decisions (AST-only mandate)

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Resolve AST node invalidation issues completely
- Maintain focus on safety and developer experience
- Provide comprehensive documentation and examples
- Establish clear standards and governance process

**Framework Philosophy:**
- Safety first - prevent dangerous operations by design
- AST-only - no pattern-based functionality allowed
- Modular - reusable components and utilities
- Testable - comprehensive test coverage required
- Maintainable - clean, documented, understandable code

This task represents the culmination of the codemod framework development work, establishing a production-ready, safe, and maintainable foundation for all future codemod development in the Minsky project.
