# Pull Request for branch `task#021`

## Summary

This PR refactors the large methods in GitService to improve maintainability and testability. The main focus was on breaking down the large `pr` method which had too many responsibilities.

### Key Changes

- Extracted the logic from `pr` method into smaller, focused methods:
  - Added a new `prWithDependencies` method that accepts injectable dependencies for easier testing
  - Extracted repository path determination into `determineWorkingDirectory`
  - Extracted branch determination logic into `determineCurrentBranch`
  - Extracted base branch and merge base detection into separate methods
  - Extracted PR content generation into dedicated methods

- Improved error handling throughout all methods
- Enhanced test compatibility to maintain full test coverage
- Maintained all existing functionality and behavior
- Added better documentation with clearer method names and comments
- The changes significantly reduced the complexity of the original method

## Testing

All tests are passing, with no regression in functionality.
