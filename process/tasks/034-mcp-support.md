# Task #034: Add MCP Support to Minsky

## Context

Minsky currently does not support the MCP (Machine Control Protocol) interface, which is required for enabling AI agents to interact with Minsky commands in a structured, programmatic way. Adding MCP support will allow external AI agents to query, invoke, and receive structured responses from Minsky commands, enabling advanced automation, integration, and agent-driven workflows.

## Requirements

1. **MCP Protocol Support**
   - Implement an MCP server or endpoint within Minsky that exposes its CLI commands via MCP.
   - Support structured request/response for all major Minsky commands (tasks, session, git, rules, etc.).
   - Ensure the protocol implementation is robust, secure, and extensible.

2. **Command Mapping**
   - Map all existing CLI commands to MCP actions, including argument and option parsing.
   - Ensure output is structured (e.g., JSON or MCP-native format) and includes error details.
   - Support both synchronous and asynchronous command execution where appropriate.

3. **AI Agent Integration**
   - Provide clear documentation and examples for how an AI agent can connect to and interact with Minsky via MCP.
   - Ensure authentication and access control are considered if exposing MCP over a network.

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Add comprehensive tests for MCP endpoints, including edge cases and error handling.
   - Validate that all mapped commands behave identically via MCP and CLI.

5. **Documentation**
   - Update Minsky documentation to describe MCP support, usage, and integration patterns for AI agents.

## Implementation Steps

1. [ ] Research and select an MCP protocol implementation or library suitable for Bun/TypeScript.
2. [ ] Design the MCP server architecture and how it will interface with existing command modules.
3. [ ] Implement the MCP server/endpoint in the Minsky codebase.
4. [ ] Map all major CLI commands to MCP actions, ensuring argument and output fidelity.
5. [ ] Add structured error handling and output formatting for MCP responses.
6. [ ] Write integration and unit tests for MCP endpoints.
7. [ ] Document MCP usage and provide agent integration examples.
8. [ ] Update project documentation and changelog.

## Verification

- [ ] All major Minsky commands are accessible via MCP
- [ ] AI agents can connect and interact with Minsky using MCP
- [ ] Structured responses and error handling are consistent with CLI behavior
- [ ] All tests pass for MCP endpoints
- [ ] Documentation is updated and includes integration examples
