# Explore embedding Outerbase DB explorer for database inspection

## Context

Research and evaluate integrating Outerbase DB explorer into Minsky to provide users with an easy way to inspect and explore their database contents. This would enhance the user experience by allowing visual database exploration without requiring separate tools.

Key areas to investigate:

- Outerbase integration options and requirements
- How to embed the explorer within Minsky's CLI/web interface
- Database connection and security considerations
- User workflow integration points
- Performance and resource implications
- Alternative database exploration tools if Outerbase isn't suitable

Expected deliverables:

- Technical feasibility analysis
- Integration approach recommendations
- Implementation plan with effort estimates
- Prototype or proof-of-concept if viable
