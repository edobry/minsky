## Work Log (2024-05-xx)

### Recent Progress
- Fixed all linter/type errors in `commit.test.ts` and committed/pushed the changes.
- Refactored `workspace.test.ts` and related domain code to support dependency injection for testability.
- Updated all test calls to inject the mock execAsync, and fixed the mock to match the expected PromiseWithChild type.
- Committed and pushed all infrastructure and linter fixes as they were made.
- Test infrastructure is now stable: mocks are called and tracked as expected.

### Current State
- `commit.test.ts`: All linter errors are fixed and committed. All logic tests pass; only CLI argument errors remain.
- `workspace.test.ts`: 7 tests pass, 8 fail. All linter/type errors are fixed. Remaining failures are due to logic or test expectation mismatches (e.g., session path, mock data, or test setup).

### Remaining Work
- Fix test data and expectations in `workspace.test.ts` to align with the actual mock and logic.
- For failing tests, ensure the mock session DB and test paths are consistent with the code's expectations.
- For any logic mismatches, update the code or tests as appropriate.
- Commit and push after each fix.
- Once all tests pass, update the changelog and finalize the task.
