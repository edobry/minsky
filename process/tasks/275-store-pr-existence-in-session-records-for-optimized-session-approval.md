## Description

# Task #275: Store PR Existence in Session Records for Optimized Session Approval

## Context

Currently, the session approval process checks for PR branch existence by calling git commands during each approval attempt. This creates unnecessary git operations and potential race conditions. A better approach would be to track PR existence state in the session records themselves.

## Problem

1. **Redundant git operations**: Every `session approve` call checks if PR branch exists via git commands
2. **Race condition potential**: Git commands can fail during timing-sensitive operations
3. **Performance impact**: Unnecessary network/disk I/O for information we could cache
4. **User experience**: Users see confusing error messages when git commands fail

## Proposed Solution

Add PR state tracking to session records:

```typescript
export interface SessionRecord {
  // ... existing fields
  prState?: {
    branchName: string;
    exists: boolean;
    lastChecked: string; // ISO timestamp
    mergedAt?: string;   // ISO timestamp when merged
  };
}
```

## Implementation Plan

1. **Extend SessionRecord interface** with PR state tracking
2. **Update session creation** to initialize PR state when branch is created
3. **Update session approval** to mark PR as merged when successful
4. **Add PR state validation** before attempting git operations
5. **Implement PR state refresh** mechanism for stale data
6. **Migrate existing sessions** to include PR state information

## Benefits

- **Performance**: Eliminates redundant git operations
- **Reliability**: Reduces race condition opportunities
- **UX**: Clearer status messaging for users
- **Maintainability**: Centralized PR state management

## Success Criteria

- [ ] SessionRecord interface includes PR state fields
- [ ] Session creation populates initial PR state
- [ ] Session approval updates PR state appropriately
- [ ] Early exit logic uses PR state instead of git commands
- [ ] Migration script for existing sessions
- [ ] Tests cover all PR state scenarios
- [ ] Performance improvement measurable in session approval time

## Migration Considerations

- Backward compatibility with existing session records
- Gradual rollout strategy for PR state population
- Fallback to git commands when PR state is missing/stale
