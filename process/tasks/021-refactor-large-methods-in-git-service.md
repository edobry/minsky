# Task #021: Refactor Large Methods in GitService

## Description

Based on codebase analysis, the `GitService` class contains excessively large methods that need refactoring for better maintainability. The `prWithDependencies` method in particular is approximately 248 lines long, making it difficult to understand, test, and maintain.

## Requirements

1. Refactor the `prWithDependencies` method in `src/domain/git.ts` into smaller, focused functions:

   - Extract branch determination logic into a separate method
   - Extract base branch detection logic into its own method
   - Extract PR content generation into a discrete method
   - Ensure all extracted methods have proper error handling

2. Maintain full test coverage during refactoring

   - All existing tests must continue to pass
   - Add targeted tests for newly extracted methods

3. Follow domain-oriented-modules principles:
   - Keep related functions together
   - Avoid creating cross-module dependencies
   - Organize code by what it operates on

## Success Criteria

- The `prWithDependencies` method is reduced to less than 50 lines
- All extracted methods have clear, specific responsibilities
- All tests pass with no regressions
- Code is more maintainable with lower cognitive complexity

## Notes

This refactoring will make the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand for new contributors. It will also make the GitService more testable by enabling more focused unit tests for the extracted methods.

## Work Log

- 2023-05-26: Refactored the `pr` method in GitService:

  - Added a `prWithDependencies` method that accepts injectable dependencies for easier testing
  - Extracted repository path determination into a separate method
  - Extracted branch determination logic into a separate method
  - Extracted base branch and merge base detection into separate methods
  - Added improved error handling throughout methods
  - Fixed and improved test compatibility
  - Maintained full test coverage with all tests passing
  - Reduced the complexity of the original method

- 2023-05-22: Further refactored the `prWithDependencies` method in GitService:
  - Extracted formatCommits into a separate method to handle commit formatting logic
  - Extracted buildPrMarkdown into a separate method for PR content generation
  - Split collectRepositoryData into multiple focused methods:
    - getCommitsOnBranch
    - getModifiedFiles
    - getWorkingDirectoryChanges
    - getChangeStats
  - Improved error handling throughout all extracted methods
  - Ensured all PR-related tests pass without regression
  - Reduced the size and complexity of the original method
  - Preserved all original functionality
