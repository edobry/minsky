# Task #127: Fixed FastMCP Method Registration Issues - Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the FastMCP method registration issues discovered in Task #124.

## Problem

FastMCP wasn't properly registering method names like `tasks.list` despite the methods being correctly registered through the `CommandMapper`. This caused JSON-RPC calls to return "Method not found" errors.

## Solution

We implemented the following improvements:

1. **Method Name Normalization**:

   - Added a `normalizeMethodName` utility in CommandMapper to ensure consistent method naming
   - This handles any problematic characters and ensures consistent format

2. **Method Name Tracking**:

   - Added a `registeredMethodNames` array to track all registered methods
   - Implemented `getRegisteredMethodNames()` method for easy access to registered methods

3. **Underscore Alias Registration**:

   - Added automatic registration of underscore-based aliases for methods with dot notation
   - For example, `tasks.list` is also registered as `tasks_list` for compatibility

4. **Improved Debug Tools**:

   - Added debug commands to help diagnose method registration issues:
     - `debug.listMethods`: Lists all registered methods
     - `debug.echo`: Tests JSON-RPC communication
     - `debug.systemInfo`: Provides system diagnostics

5. **MCP Server Changes**:

   - Removed inline debug tool registration in server.ts
   - Integrated debug tools through CommandMapper for consistent method registration
   - Ensured debug tools are registered first for diagnostic capabilities

6. **Enhanced Test Client**:
   - Updated test-mcp.js with better diagnostics and user interface
   - Added support for method name variants to help test different formats
   - Improved error reporting and debugging capabilities

## Files Modified

1. `src/mcp/command-mapper.ts`

   - Added method normalization and tracking functionality
   - Implemented underscore alias registration for dot notation methods

2. `src/mcp/server.ts`

   - Removed inline debug tool registration
   - Added command mapper integration point instead

3. `src/commands/mcp/index.ts`

   - Added debug tools registration
   - Ensured debug tools are registered first

4. `src/adapters/mcp/debug.ts`

   - Created new module for debug tools
   - Implemented improved method listing with CommandMapper integration

5. `test-mcp.js`
   - Enhanced the test client with better debugging and method testing

## Testing

The solution has been tested using multiple approaches:

1. **Debug Scripts**: Created specialized scripts to verify method registration
2. **Test Methods**: Verified that methods like `debug.listMethods` are properly registered
3. **Method Format Testing**: Tested various method name formats to ensure compatibility
4. **Enhanced Test Client**: Used the updated test-mcp.js to verify command execution
