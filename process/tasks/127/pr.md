# fix(#127): Fix FastMCP Method Registration Issues

## Summary

This PR fixes the FastMCP method registration issues discovered in Task #124. Previously, methods like `tasks.list` were not being properly registered with FastMCP, causing JSON-RPC calls to return "Method not found" errors. This PR implements a comprehensive solution to ensure consistent method registration and provides better debug tools.

## Changes

### Added

- New `normalizeMethodName` utility in CommandMapper for consistent method naming
- Method name tracking in CommandMapper with `registeredMethodNames` array and `getRegisteredMethodNames()` method
- Automatic registration of underscore-based aliases for methods with dot notation (e.g., `tasks.list` is also registered as `tasks_list`)
- Improved debug tools including `debug.listMethods`, `debug.echo`, and `debug.systemInfo`

### Fixed

- Fixed FastMCP method registration issues where methods like `tasks.list` were not being properly registered
- Improved error handling and logging in MCP commands

### Changed

- Updated test-mcp.js script with enhanced debugging capabilities and better JSON-RPC request handling
- Modified MCP server initialization to register debug tools through CommandMapper

## Testing

The solution has been tested using multiple approaches:

1. Created specialized debug scripts to verify method registration
2. Verified that debug methods like `debug.listMethods` are properly registered
3. Tested various method name formats to ensure compatibility
4. Used the updated test-mcp.js script to verify command execution in a realistic setting

## Checklist

- [x] All requirements implemented
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] Code quality is acceptable
- [x] Documentation is updated
- [x] Changelog is updated
