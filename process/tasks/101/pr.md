# feat(#101): Improve Domain Module Testability with Proper Dependency Injection

## Summary

This PR improves the testability of the domain module through proper dependency injection. It introduces interfaces for core domain services, implements a consistent pattern for dependency injection across the codebase, and adds test utilities for generating dependency mocks.

## Changes

### Added
- Created `SessionProviderInterface` for session database operations
- Created `GitServiceInterface` for git service operations
- Added factory functions (`createSessionProvider`, `createGitService`) for default implementations
- Created `createTestDeps` utility for generating test dependencies

### Changed
- Refactored `resolveRepoPath` to accept injected dependencies
- Updated `approveSessionFromParams` to use consistent dependency injection pattern
- Improved test structure with better isolation and no type casting
- Updated repo-utils tests to demonstrate the new dependency injection pattern

### Fixed
- Eliminated need for modifying readonly properties in tests
- Removed type casting ('as any') from tests
- Improved test reliability with consistent dependency patterns

## Testing

All changes have been tested with the existing test suite, with improved tests for `repo-utils` that demonstrate the new dependency injection pattern. The changes make the domain code more modular and easier to test by clearly defining dependencies and providing mechanisms for injecting mocks during testing.

## Checklist

- [x] All requirements implemented
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] Code quality is acceptable
- [x] Documentation is updated
- [x] Changelog is updated
