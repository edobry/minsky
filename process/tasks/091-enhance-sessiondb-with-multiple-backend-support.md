# Task #091: Enhance SessionDB with Multiple Backend Support

## Context

The current implementation of SessionDB uses the filesystem to store session records. This approach is sufficient for individual development environments but becomes limiting when scaling to team environments or container-based workflows. Task #080 identified the need for a more robust storage approach that can support multiple backends, particularly databases like SQLite and PostgreSQL.

## Requirements

1. **Storage Backend Abstraction**

   - Create an abstract interface for session storage
   - Support the current filesystem implementation as the default
   - Add support for additional backends:
     - SQLite (local development)
     - PostgreSQL (team/server environments)

2. **Backend Selection Mechanism**

   - Implement configuration for selecting storage backends
   - Support environment-based backend selection
   - Provide migration tools between backends

3. **Session Record Consistency**

   - Ensure consistent session record structure across backends
   - Implement validation for session records
   - Support atomic operations where possible

4. **Performance Considerations**
   - Optimize read/write operations for each backend
   - Implement appropriate caching mechanisms
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing code

## Implementation Steps

1. [ ] Design storage abstraction:

   - [ ] Create `SessionStorage` interface
   - [ ] Define standard CRUD operations
   - [ ] Document interface requirements

2. [ ] Implement filesystem backend:

   - [ ] Refactor current implementation to implement the new interface
   - [ ] Ensure backward compatibility
   - [ ] Add comprehensive tests

3. [ ] Implement SQLite backend:

   - [ ] Create SQLite schema for session records
   - [ ] Implement the `SessionStorage` interface for SQLite
   - [ ] Add migration tools from filesystem to SQLite
   - [ ] Add comprehensive tests

4. [ ] Design PostgreSQL backend (optional implementation):

   - [ ] Create PostgreSQL schema for session records
   - [ ] Implement the `SessionStorage` interface for PostgreSQL
   - [ ] Add migration tools for PostgreSQL
   - [ ] Document team setup requirements

5. [ ] Implement backend factory and configuration:
   - [ ] Create factory for selecting appropriate backend
   - [ ] Add configuration options
   - [ ] Document setup and migration process

## Verification

- [ ] All backends correctly implement the `SessionStorage` interface
- [ ] Sessions can be created, retrieved, updated, and deleted with all backends
- [ ] Migration between backends works correctly
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for all operations
- [ ] Backward compatibility is maintained
- [ ] All tests pass with each backend
