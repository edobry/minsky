# Enhance SessionDB with Multiple Backend Support

## Context

The current implementation of SessionDB uses a JSON file stored on the filesystem to store session records. This approach is sufficient for individual development environments but becomes limiting when scaling to team environments or container-based workflows. Task #080 identified the need for a more robust storage approach that can support multiple backends, particularly databases like SQLite and PostgreSQL.

## Requirements

1. **Storage Backend Abstraction**

   - Create an abstract `DatabaseStorage<T, S>` interface for data storage operations
   - Support the current JSON file implementation (rename from "filesystem" to "JsonFileStorage") as the default
   - Add support for additional backends:
     - SQLite (local development)
     - PostgreSQL (team/server environments)

2. **Generic Database Layer**

   - Extract reusable database operations (read/write/query) currently in session-db-io.ts
   - Create standardized error handling and state management patterns
   - Build migration utilities between different storage backends

3. **Backend Selection Mechanism**

   - Implement configuration for selecting storage backends
   - Support environment-based backend selection
   - Provide migration tools between backends

4. **Session Record Consistency**

   - Ensure consistent session record structure across backends
   - Implement validation for session records
   - Support atomic operations where possible

5. **Performance Considerations**
   - Optimize read/write operations for each backend
   - Implement appropriate caching mechanisms
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing code

## Implementation Steps

1. [ ] Design database storage abstraction:

   - [ ] Create `DatabaseStorage<T, S>` interface with generic types
   - [ ] Define standard CRUD operations
   - [ ] Extract common utilities (path resolution, error handling, etc.)
   - [ ] Document interface requirements

2. [ ] Extract reusable database layer components:

   - [ ] Create a common utilities module for filesystem operations
   - [ ] Extract state management patterns
   - [ ] Build standardized error handling

3. [ ] Implement JsonFileStorage backend:

   - [ ] Refactor current implementation to implement the new interface
   - [ ] Ensure backward compatibility
   - [ ] Add comprehensive tests

4. [ ] Implement SQLite backend:

   - [ ] Create SQLite schema for session records
   - [ ] Implement the `DatabaseStorage` interface for SQLite
   - [ ] Add migration tools from JsonFile to SQLite
   - [ ] Add comprehensive tests

5. [ ] Design PostgreSQL backend (optional implementation):

   - [ ] Create PostgreSQL schema for session records
   - [ ] Implement the `DatabaseStorage` interface for PostgreSQL
   - [ ] Add migration tools for PostgreSQL
   - [ ] Document team setup requirements

6. [ ] Implement backend factory and configuration:
   - [ ] Create factory for selecting appropriate backend
   - [ ] Add configuration options
   - [ ] Document setup and migration process

## Verification

- [ ] All backends correctly implement the `DatabaseStorage` interface
- [ ] Sessions can be created, retrieved, updated, and deleted with all backends
- [ ] Migration between backends works correctly
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for all operations
- [ ] Backward compatibility is maintained
- [ ] All tests pass with each backend
