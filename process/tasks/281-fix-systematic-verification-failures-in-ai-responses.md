# Task #281: Fix Systematic Verification Failures in AI Responses

## Problem Statement

AI responses are claiming resources don't exist without proper verification, leading to incorrect information being provided to users. This was demonstrated when the AI claimed the `self-improvement.mdc` rule didn't exist when it clearly does exist in the workspace.

## Root Cause Analysis

**Error Category: Verification Error**

- Failed to use proper search tools before making negative claims
- Relied on incomplete rule fetching instead of comprehensive file search
- Did not follow existing verification protocols

## Requirements

1. **Mandatory Verification Protocol**: Before claiming any resource doesn't exist, must:

   - Use file_search tool to look for the resource
   - Use grep_search if needed for content verification
   - Only claim non-existence after exhaustive search

2. **Update Self-Improvement Rule**: Add specific verification failure patterns and prevention steps

3. **Create Verification Checklist**: Systematic checklist for resource existence claims

4. **Rule System Enhancement**: Improve rule fetching to be more comprehensive

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All negative existence claims must be backed by proper tool usage
- [x] Self-improvement rule updated with verification failure patterns
- [x] Verification checklist created and integrated
- [x] Test case created to prevent regression

## Implementation Completed

### 1. Updated Self-Improvement Rule

- Added "Critical Resource Existence Verification Protocol" section
- Documented specific failure patterns and user signals
- Created mandatory verification protocol with 4-step process
- Added examples of correct vs incorrect approaches
- Implemented enforcement mechanisms

### 2. Created Verification Checklist Rule

- New rule: `.cursor/rules/verification-checklist.mdc`
- Comprehensive checklist for resource existence verification
- Response templates for found/not found scenarios
- Prohibited response patterns clearly defined
- Always-apply rule to catch all negative existence claims

### 3. Created Test Case

- Test file: `tests/verification-protocol.test.ts`
- Documents the specific self-improvement rule failure case
- Verifies all mandatory verification steps are enforced
- Prevents regression of verification failures
- All tests passing

### 4. Enhanced Rule System

- Both rules now work together as a system
- Self-improvement rule handles error detection and correction
- Verification checklist provides specific implementation guidance
- Clear enforcement hierarchy established

## Implementation Notes

This task directly addresses the systematic verification failure demonstrated in the conversation where `self-improvement.mdc` was incorrectly claimed to not exist.

## Immediate Actions Required

1. Update the self-improvement rule to include verification failure patterns
2. Create mandatory verification protocol before negative claims
3. Add enforcement mechanisms to prevent recurrence

## Context

This task was created as part of the self-improvement protocol after the AI incorrectly claimed that the `self-improvement.mdc` rule didn't exist when asked about it by the user.
