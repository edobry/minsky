# Fix CLI session pr command issues in session workspaces

## Status

IN-PROGRESS

## Priority

MEDIUM

## Description

The `minsky session pr` command fails when run from new session workspaces due to several issues:

1. **Non-existent remote branch handling**: New sessions fail because `session update` tries to pull from remote branches that don't exist yet (e.g., `git pull origin task#210` when `task#210` hasn't been pushed)

2. **--no-update flag not working**: Even when `--no-update` is specified, the session update is still attempted, causing the same failure

3. **Poor UX for common workflow**: Creating a session and immediately trying to create a PR (the most common workflow) always fails

## Requirements

1. **Fix --no-update flag**: Ensure `minsky session pr --no-update` actually skips the session update step

2. **Smart remote branch handling**: Make session update logic handle non-existent remote branches gracefully:

   - Check if remote branch exists before attempting pull
   - Skip pull for new sessions that haven't been pushed yet
   - Provide clear messaging about what's happening

3. **Better error messages**: When session update fails, provide actionable guidance for common scenarios

4. **Maintain existing functionality**: Ensure existing sessions with remote branches continue to work correctly

## Success Criteria

1. `minsky session pr --title "Test" --no-update` works from new session workspaces
2. `minsky session pr --title "Test"` provides helpful error messages or handles gracefully for new sessions
3. Existing sessions with remote branches continue to update correctly
4. Clear documentation of expected behavior for different scenarios
