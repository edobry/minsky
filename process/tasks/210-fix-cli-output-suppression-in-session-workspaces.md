# Fix CLI session pr command issues in session workspaces

## Status

DONE

## Priority

MEDIUM

## Description

The `minsky session pr` command fails when run from new session workspaces due to several issues:

1. **Non-existent remote branch handling**: New sessions fail because `session update` tries to pull from remote branches that don't exist yet (e.g., `git pull origin task#210` when `task#210` hasn't been pushed)

2. **--no-update flag not working**: Even when `--no-update` is specified, the session update is still attempted, causing the same failure

3. **Poor UX for common workflow**: Creating a session and immediately trying to create a PR (the most common workflow) always fails

**ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERED**: The fundamental issue was in the `pullLatest` function in `git.ts` which was doing `git pull origin <currentBranch>` instead of `git fetch origin`. Session updates should fetch latest refs from origin, then merge `origin/main` INTO the session branch, not sync the session branch with its remote version.

## Requirements

✅ **Fix --no-update flag**: Ensure `minsky session pr --no-update` actually skips the session update step
✅ **Smart remote branch handling**: Make session update logic handle non-existent remote branches gracefully
✅ **Better error messages**: When session update fails, provide actionable guidance for common scenarios
✅ **Maintain existing functionality**: Ensure existing sessions with remote branches continue to work correctly
✅ **Root cause fix**: Fixed `pullLatest` to use `git fetch origin` instead of `git pull origin <currentBranch>`

## Success Criteria

✅ `minsky session pr --title "Test" --no-update` works from new session workspaces
✅ `minsky session pr --title "Test"` works without the `--skip-update` workaround
✅ Existing sessions with remote branches continue to update correctly
✅ Clear documentation of expected behavior for different scenarios
✅ Session update logic properly fetches and merges main branch changes

## Resolution Summary

1. **Fixed CLI parameter mapping**: Changed `skipUpdate` to `noUpdate` in CLI factory configuration
2. **Fixed parameter usage**: Updated `sessionPrFromParams` to use `noUpdate` instead of `skipUpdate`
3. **Fixed root cause**: Changed `pullLatest` in `git.ts` to use `git fetch origin` instead of `git pull origin <currentBranch>`
4. **Resolved all merge conflicts**: Session workspace is clean and ready for PR submission
5. **Tested successfully**: Session PR commands now work without workarounds
