# Task #116: Improve CI/CD Test Stability with Progressive Migration

## Context

Our test suite is currently experiencing significant issues when running under Bun's test runner, with 114 failing tests. These failures impact our continuous integration and deployment pipelines, reducing confidence in the build process and potentially allowing bugs to slip through.

While we're working on a comprehensive testing infrastructure migration plan through the other tasks in this initiative, we need a short-term solution to stabilize our CI/CD pipelines while the longer-term migration is in progress.

This task focuses on implementing a progressive migration strategy for our CI/CD pipeline, allowing us to gradually migrate tests while maintaining build stability. It will work in conjunction with the other testing tasks but focuses specifically on CI/CD integration and build reliability.

## Requirements

1. **Progressive Test Runner Configuration**

   - Implement a configuration system that can run tests with either Jest/Vitest or Bun
   - Create a mechanism to designate which tests run with which runner
   - Support running the same tests with both runners for comparison
   - Enable progressive migration of tests between runners

2. **Test Result Aggregation**

   - Create a system to aggregate test results from multiple test runners
   - Generate unified test reports that combine results
   - Track success rates for tests run with different runners
   - Identify inconsistencies between test runners

3. **CI/CD Integration**

   - Update CI/CD pipelines to support the progressive migration
   - Implement stages for running tests with different runners
   - Create fallback mechanisms for critical tests
   - Add monitoring for test stability and migration progress

4. **Test Migration Tracking**

   - Implement a system to track which tests have been migrated
   - Create dashboards for migration progress
   - Track success rates for migrated tests
   - Monitor performance differences between runners

5. **Stability Metrics**
   - Define metrics for test stability and reliability
   - Implement collection of these metrics during test runs
   - Create visualizations and reports for stability metrics
   - Establish thresholds for acceptable stability

## Minimal Implementation Plan

### Core Problem: Fix CI by running tests that work

**Goal**: Get CI green while Task 113's migration tool fixes tests in the background.

### Simple 3-Step Solution:

1. **Quick Test Categorization** (1 day)
   - [x] Run `bun test` and identify which tests actually pass
   - [x] Create simple `test-categories.json` file:
     ```json
     {
       "bun_compatible": ["src/utils/__tests__/**/*.test.ts", "src/domain/__tests__/**/*.test.ts"],
       "needs_migration": ["src/test-migration/**/*.test.ts"]
     }
     ```

2. **Two-Stage CI Pipeline** (1 day)
   - [x] Create `.github/workflows/progressive-test.yml` with:
     - Stage 1: Run Bun-compatible tests with `bun test`
     - Stage 2: Run remaining tests with `npx vitest` (fallback)
   - [x] Both stages must pass for green CI

3. **Simple Migration Tracking** (1 day)
   - [x] Add script `scripts/migrate-test.sh` to test individual files
   - [ ] Update CI to automatically pick up newly compatible tests

### That's it. No enterprise dashboards, no complex aggregation, just working CI.

## Verification

- [ ] CI/CD pipelines run successfully with the progressive migration strategy
- [ ] Test results are correctly aggregated from multiple runners
- [ ] Migration progress is accurately tracked and reported
- [ ] Stability metrics provide useful insights into test reliability
- [ ] Critical tests have appropriate fallback mechanisms
- [ ] The migration process is well-documented and understood by the team
- [ ] Build reliability improves over time as tests are migrated

## Dependencies

- This task integrates with the "Core Mock Compatibility Layer" to support tests during migration
- This task uses insights from the "Test Inventory and Classification" to identify migration candidates
- This task supports the "High-Priority Test Migration" by providing a framework for gradually rolling out changes
- This task implements monitoring for the effectiveness of the "Dependency Injection Test Patterns"

## Special Considerations

This task is unique in that it focuses on maintaining stability during the migration process rather than directly contributing to the migration itself. It creates the infrastructure needed to safely roll out changes from the other tasks without disrupting the development workflow.
