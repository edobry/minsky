# Task #116: Improve CI/CD Test Stability with Progressive Migration

## Context

Our test suite is currently experiencing significant issues when running under Bun's test runner, with 114 failing tests. These failures impact our continuous integration and deployment pipelines, reducing confidence in the build process and potentially allowing bugs to slip through.

While we're working on a comprehensive testing infrastructure migration plan through the other tasks in this initiative, we need a short-term solution to stabilize our CI/CD pipelines while the longer-term migration is in progress.

This task focuses on implementing a progressive migration strategy for our CI/CD pipeline, allowing us to gradually migrate tests while maintaining build stability. It will work in conjunction with the other testing tasks but focuses specifically on CI/CD integration and build reliability.

## Requirements

1. **Progressive Test Runner Configuration**

   - Implement a configuration system that can run tests with either Jest/Vitest or Bun
   - Create a mechanism to designate which tests run with which runner
   - Support running the same tests with both runners for comparison
   - Enable progressive migration of tests between runners

2. **Test Result Aggregation**

   - Create a system to aggregate test results from multiple test runners
   - Generate unified test reports that combine results
   - Track success rates for tests run with different runners
   - Identify inconsistencies between test runners

3. **CI/CD Integration**

   - Update CI/CD pipelines to support the progressive migration
   - Implement stages for running tests with different runners
   - Create fallback mechanisms for critical tests
   - Add monitoring for test stability and migration progress

4. **Test Migration Tracking**

   - Implement a system to track which tests have been migrated
   - Create dashboards for migration progress
   - Track success rates for migrated tests
   - Monitor performance differences between runners

5. **Stability Metrics**
   - Define metrics for test stability and reliability
   - Implement collection of these metrics during test runs
   - Create visualizations and reports for stability metrics
   - Establish thresholds for acceptable stability

## Implementation Steps

1. [ ] Design the progressive test runner configuration:

   - [ ] Create a configuration format for specifying test runners
   - [ ] Implement a mechanism to select runners for specific tests
   - [ ] Add support for running tests with multiple runners
   - [ ] Create utilities for managing test runner configuration

2. [ ] Implement test result aggregation:

   - [ ] Create a common format for test results
   - [ ] Implement collectors for different test runners
   - [ ] Develop a system to merge results from different runners
   - [ ] Create unified test reports

3. [ ] Update CI/CD pipeline configuration:

   - [ ] Modify pipeline stages to support multiple test runners
   - [ ] Implement conditional test execution based on migration status
   - [ ] Add fallback mechanisms for critical tests
   - [ ] Create notifications for test failures

4. [ ] Build test migration tracking:

   - [ ] Create a database or file format for tracking migration status
   - [ ] Implement utilities for updating migration status
   - [ ] Develop dashboards for monitoring migration progress
   - [ ] Add reporting on migration success rates

5. [ ] Define and collect stability metrics:

   - [ ] Identify key metrics for test stability
   - [ ] Implement collection of these metrics
   - [ ] Create visualizations for stability trends
   - [ ] Set up alerts for stability regressions

6. [ ] Implement gradual migration strategy:

   - [ ] Define phases for test migration
   - [ ] Create criteria for promoting tests between phases
   - [ ] Implement automation for phase transitions
   - [ ] Document the migration process

7. [ ] Create documentation and training:
   - [ ] Document the progressive migration approach
   - [ ] Create guidelines for developers running tests locally
   - [ ] Document the CI/CD integration
   - [ ] Provide training on managing test migrations

## Verification

- [ ] CI/CD pipelines run successfully with the progressive migration strategy
- [ ] Test results are correctly aggregated from multiple runners
- [ ] Migration progress is accurately tracked and reported
- [ ] Stability metrics provide useful insights into test reliability
- [ ] Critical tests have appropriate fallback mechanisms
- [ ] The migration process is well-documented and understood by the team
- [ ] Build reliability improves over time as tests are migrated

## Dependencies

- This task integrates with the "Core Mock Compatibility Layer" to support tests during migration
- This task uses insights from the "Test Inventory and Classification" to identify migration candidates
- This task supports the "High-Priority Test Migration" by providing a framework for gradually rolling out changes
- This task implements monitoring for the effectiveness of the "Dependency Injection Test Patterns"

## Special Considerations

This task is unique in that it focuses on maintaining stability during the migration process rather than directly contributing to the migration itself. It creates the infrastructure needed to safely roll out changes from the other tasks without disrupting the development workflow.
