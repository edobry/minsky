# Session PR Workflow Error Documentation

## Error Encountered

We encountered a critical workflow error in handling PR updates for Task #309. After creating the initial PR, we made additional changes to the session branch without properly updating the PR.

## Root Cause

1. The initial PR was created from the task309 branch
2. After receiving review feedback, changes were made directly to the task309 branch
3. These changes weren't properly incorporated into the existing PR
4. The Minsky CLI couldn't be used due to our changes breaking imports

## Resolution

1. Created a new branch (task309-update) with all changes
2. Pushed this branch to the repository
3. A new PR will need to be created from this updated branch
4. The original PR should be closed in favor of the new one

## Workflow Lesson

**Critical Rule:** After creating a PR from a session branch, do not make additional changes directly to that branch without properly updating the PR. If changes are needed:

1. Create a new branch from the latest session branch
2. Make changes to this new branch
3. Create a new PR from this branch
4. Close the original PR

This ensures that PRs remain in sync with their source branches and prevents confusion in the review process.
