# PR Update: Improved Error Classification in File Operation Tools

## Changes Made Since Previous PR

This PR update addresses critical feedback from the senior engineer review:

1. **Removed filesystem I/O from error handling paths**
   - Eliminated all `fs.stat()` calls during error classification
   - Error handling no longer performs any filesystem operations
   - Prevents potential cascading failures in error paths

2. **Made error classification synchronous**
   - Removed async/await from the error classifier
   - Simplified implementation with pure synchronous processing
   - Better performance during error handling

3. **Improved heuristic robustness**
   - Enhanced error message parsing for better accuracy
   - Simplified pattern matching for path extraction
   - Improved directory vs file error detection

4. **Fixed deployment blocker**
   - Addressed the CLI import issues

## Testing Verification
- All tests pass with the simplified implementation
- Added integration tests to verify error classification robustness

## Security and Performance Considerations
- Error handling now has zero additional I/O operations
- No performance overhead from filesystem access
- Reduced complexity means fewer potential failure points
