# Implement Session-Aware Versions of Cursor Built-in Tools

## 🚨 CRITICAL STATUS CORRECTION (Updated January 2025)

**MAJOR DISCREPANCY DISCOVERED**: The previous status claims in this spec do not match the actual implementation state. Below is the corrected analysis:

### ❌ **PREVIOUS CLAIMS vs ✅ ACTUAL STATE**

**❌ INCORRECTLY CLAIMED "Phase 1: ✅ COMPLETED"**
- **REALITY**: Phase 1 tools are implemented but **NOT ACTIVE**
- **Files exist**: `src/adapters/mcp/session-edit-tools.ts` with `session_edit_file` and `session_search_replace`
- **Critical Issue**: Tools are **commented out** in MCP server registration (`src/commands/mcp/index.ts:149`)
- **Impact**: AI agents cannot access these tools despite implementation being complete

**❌ INCORRECTLY CLAIMED "Phase 2: Ready for Implementation"**
- **REALITY**: Phase 2 tools are **completely missing** from codebase
- **No implementations found** for:
  - `session_grep_search` - not implemented
  - `session_file_search` - not implemented
  - `session_codebase_search` - not implemented
- **Analysis exists**: Comprehensive reverse engineering documentation completed
- **Gap**: Implementation work has not started despite extensive specifications

**✅ WHAT IS ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED AND ACTIVE:**
1. **Basic session file operations** (different interface than Cursor):
   - `session_read_file`, `session_write_file`, `session_list_directory`
   - `session_file_exists`, `session_delete_file`, `session_create_directory`
2. **Core session management tools**: Active via shared command integration
3. **Git, tasks, rules, debug tools**: Active and working

### **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**

**🔥 Priority 1: Activate Existing Phase 1 Tools**
- Uncomment and register `session_edit_file` and `session_search_replace` in MCP server
- These tools are fully implemented and tested but not accessible to AI agents

**🔥 Priority 2: Implement Missing Phase 2 Search Tools**
- Complete specifications exist but implementations are missing
- Critical for AI agent workflow efficiency

**🔥 Priority 3: Reconcile Interface Conflicts**
- Current `session_read_file` may conflict with Phase 3 plans
- Need to align basic operations with Cursor-compatible interfaces

### **CORRECTED IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:**

| Phase | Tool | Implementation Status | Registration Status | AI Agent Access |
|-------|------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | `session_edit_file` | ✅ Complete | ❌ Commented out | ❌ No access |
| 1 | `session_search_replace` | ✅ Complete | ❌ Commented out | ❌ No access |
| 2 | `session_grep_search` | ❌ Missing | ❌ N/A | ❌ No access |
| 2 | `session_file_search` | ❌ Missing | ❌ N/A | ❌ No access |
| 2 | `session_codebase_search` | ❌ Missing | ❌ N/A | ❌ No access |
| Basic | `session_read_file` | ✅ Complete | ✅ Active | ✅ Available |
| Basic | `session_write_file` | ✅ Complete | ✅ Active | ✅ Available |
| Basic | `session_list_directory` | ✅ Complete | ✅ Active | ✅ Available |

**BOTTOM LINE**: This task is much further from completion than previously indicated. The foundation is solid with excellent analysis, but core deliverables are missing or inactive.

## Context

Cursor provides a comprehensive set of built-in tools that enable AI coding agents to interact with the development environment. These tools include file operations, code search, terminal execution, and external integrations. However, these tools operate in the context of the main workspace, which conflicts with Minsky's session-based workflow where all task-related changes must occur within isolated session workspaces.

A comprehensive analysis of Cursor's built-in tools has been documented in [docs/cursor-built-in-tools-analysis.md](../../docs/cursor-built-in-tools-analysis.md). This task will implement session-aware versions of the relevant tools to provide AI coding agents with a fully equivalent environment that enforces session workspace isolation.

**IMPORTANT**: This task requires extensive research and analysis to understand the exact nature, origins, and implementations of Cursor's built-in tools before proceeding with implementation.

## Research and Analysis Requirements

### 1. Tool Origin Investigation

**CRITICAL**: Before implementing any tools, conduct comprehensive research to identify the specific libraries, frameworks, and systems that Cursor's tools originate from:

#### Research Questions to Answer:

1. **Are these custom Cursor implementations** or adaptations of open-source MCP tools?
2. **Which specific MCP libraries or frameworks** does Cursor likely use?
3. **Are any tools based on Language Server Protocol (LSP)** implementations?
4. **Do any tools use established libraries** (e.g., ripgrep for `grep_search`, fzf for `file_search`)?
5. **What semantic search technology** does `codebase_search` likely use? (embeddings, AST analysis, etc.)
6. **Is `run_terminal_cmd` using established libraries** like node-pty, xterm.js, or custom implementations?
7. **Do external integration tools** (`web_search`, `fetch_pull_request`) use specific APIs or services?

#### Research Methods:

- **Web research** on Cursor's architecture and tooling
- **MCP protocol documentation** and available tool libraries
- **GitHub repository analysis** of related open-source tools
- **Community forums and documentation** about Cursor's implementation
- **Technical blog posts** or talks by Cursor team
- **Comparison with other AI coding assistants** (GitHub Copilot, Codeium, etc.)

#### Deliverable:

Create a detailed mapping document: `docs/cursor-tool-origins-analysis.md` containing:

- Identified source libraries/frameworks for each tool
- Confidence level for each identification (High/Medium/Low/Unknown)
- Alternative implementation approaches when source is unknown
- Licensing and compatibility considerations
- Integration complexity assessment

### 2. Deep Tool Analysis and Comparison

For each Cursor tool, conduct detailed analysis:

#### Individual Tool Investigation:

1. **Exact parameter schemas** - What parameters does each tool accept?
2. **Return value formats** - What data structures are returned?
3. **Error handling patterns** - How do tools handle edge cases?
4. **Performance characteristics** - What are latency and throughput expectations?
5. **Usage patterns** - How do AI agents typically use each tool?
6. **Dependencies and requirements** - What external systems are needed?

#### Critical Evaluation Questions:

1. **Is this tool essential for AI coding workflows?** (Critical/Important/Nice-to-have/Unnecessary)
2. **Can we safely omit this tool** without significantly impacting AI agent capabilities?
3. **Should we match Cursor's implementation exactly** or is a different approach justified?
4. **What are the technical tradeoffs** of different implementation approaches?
5. **How does this tool integrate with others** in typical AI workflows?

### 3. Gap Analysis and Prioritization

#### Compare Our Current Implementation:

Current Minsky session tools:

- ✅ `session_read_file`, `session_write_file`, `session_delete_file`
- ✅ `session_list_directory`, `session_file_exists`, `session_create_directory`

Against Cursor's complete toolset:

- ❓ `edit_file`, `search_replace`, `reapply`
- ❓ `codebase_search`, `grep_search`, `file_search`
- ❓ `run_terminal_cmd`
- ❓ `web_search`, `fetch_pull_request`, `fetch_github_issue`
- ❓ `create_diagram`, `edit_notebook`
- ❓ `fetch_rules`

#### Evaluation Criteria:

For each missing tool, determine:

1. **Criticality Score** (1-10): How essential is this for AI coding workflows?
2. **Implementation Complexity** (Low/Medium/High): Development effort required
3. **Session Relevance** (High/Medium/Low/None): Does this need session-aware version?
4. **Alternative Solutions**: Can existing tools cover this functionality?

#### Research Deliverable:

Create `docs/cursor-tool-gap-analysis.md` with:

- Prioritized list of missing tools
- Justification for inclusion/exclusion decisions
- Implementation complexity assessment
- Recommended development order

### 4. User Feedback and Clarification Protocol

When research reveals ambiguities or underspecified requirements:

#### Required User Consultation Areas:

1. **Conflicting information** about tool implementations
2. **Unclear tool priorities** when multiple approaches are valid
3. **Licensing or legal concerns** with identified source libraries
4. **Technical architecture decisions** that impact the overall system
5. **Resource allocation questions** for complex implementations

#### Consultation Format:

- Present research findings clearly
- Outline specific decision points requiring input
- Provide recommended approaches with rationale
- Include implementation tradeoffs and timeline impacts

## Problem Statement

AI coding agents using Minsky need access to the same comprehensive toolset available in Cursor, but with these critical differences:

1. All file operations must be scoped to session workspaces
2. All search operations must be limited to session workspace content
3. Terminal commands must execute within session workspace context
4. Tools must be discoverable and usable by various AI coding agents (not just Cursor)

## Implementation Approach Decision ✅

**DECISION FINALIZED**: After consultation with MCP expert, proceeding with **direct implementation approach** using open source libraries and existing tools wherever possible.

### Selected Strategy: Direct Implementation with Open Source Libraries

1. **Primary Approach**: Implement session-aware versions of critical tools directly
2. **Leverage Existing Libraries**: Use proven open source libraries (ripgrep, fzf, etc.) identified through research
3. **Incremental Delivery**: Focus on most critical tools first for immediate workflow improvement
4. **Session Workspace Enforcement**: All tools use absolute session workspace paths for proper isolation

### Rejected Approaches:

- **Tool Proxy/Recommendation Pattern**: Determined to be architecturally unreliable after expert consultation
- **Cursor Tool Delegation**: MCP protocol limitations make this approach infeasible

## Updated Requirements

### 1. Research-Driven Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

Research phase completed with comprehensive analysis of tool origins and implementation approaches.

### 2. Evidence-Based Tool Selection

Based on research findings:

- Implement only tools identified as **Critical** or **Important** for AI workflows
- Justify any deviations from Cursor's exact interface based on technical or architectural reasons
- Document rationale for omitted tools
- Prioritize based on usage frequency and workflow impact

### 3. Core File Operation Tools

Implement session-aware versions based on research findings:

- **`session_edit_file`**:

  - Match Cursor's exact interface and behavior patterns
  - Support the same `// ... existing code ...` pattern as Cursor
  - Enforce session workspace boundaries
  - Support file creation
  - Maintain compatibility with AI agent expectations

- **`session_search_replace`**:
  - Implement based on research of Cursor's approach
  - Replace single occurrence with contextual matching
  - Optimized for large files (>2500 lines as per Cursor docs)
  - Enforce session workspace boundaries

### 4. Search and Discovery Tools

Implementation approach based on identified source technologies:

- **`session_grep_search`**:

  - Use same underlying technology as Cursor (likely ripgrep)
  - Fast regex pattern matching within session
  - Support include/exclude patterns
  - Case sensitivity options
  - Results capped appropriately (50 matches as per Cursor)

- **`session_codebase_search`**:

  - Implement using same semantic search approach as Cursor
  - Semantic search within session workspace only
  - Directory filtering with glob patterns
  - Relevance scoring matching Cursor's approach

- **`session_file_search`**:
  - Use same fuzzy matching algorithm as Cursor
  - Fuzzy file path matching within session
  - Efficient implementation for large codebases
  - Results capped to 10 as per Cursor

### 5. Command Execution

- **`session_run_command`**:
  - Implement based on Cursor's approach (likely node-pty or similar)
  - Execute commands with pwd set to session workspace
  - Maintain shell context between calls
  - Support for background processes and timeouts
  - Environment isolation between sessions
  - **Note**: Security considerations will be addressed separately

### 6. External Integration Assessment

Based on research, evaluate whether these tools need session-aware versions:

- `web_search` - likely no session modifications needed
- `fetch_pull_request`, `fetch_github_issue` - may need session context for proper attribution
- `create_diagram` - no session modifications needed
- `edit_notebook` - needs session workspace enforcement

## ✅ **COMPLETED: Session Context Resolution Architecture Design**

### **🎯 Problem Identified: Mixed Concerns in Session Context Resolution**

**Issue**: Session commands had different behavior based on `process.cwd()`, mixing interface concerns with domain logic.

**Solution Designed and Partially Implemented**:
- **Interface-Layer Resolution Architecture**: CLI adapter auto-detects session, MCP adapter requires explicit session
- **Session Commands**: Clean session operations with no process.cwd() dependencies
- **Test-Driven Development**: 15/15 tests pass for interface-layer resolution, plus failing tests that demonstrate the original problem
- **⚠️ Integration Status**: Architecture designed and tested, but not yet integrated into CLI command flow

### **🏗️ Architecture Implementation Completed**

1. **Interface Adapters** (`src/adapters/session-context-resolver.ts`):
   - `CLISessionContextResolver` - auto-detects session from working directory
   - `MCPSessionContextResolver` - requires explicit session parameter
   - Backward compatible for CLI, explicit for MCP programmatic usage

2. **Session Commands** (`src/domain/session/session-commands.ts`):
   - Clean session operations with no process.cwd() dependencies
   - Consistent behavior regardless of interface

3. **Activated Session Tools** (8 total now available):
   - ✅ `session_edit_file`, `session_search_replace` (Cursor-compatible)
   - ✅ `session_read_file`, `session_write_file`, `session_list_directory`
   - ✅ `session_file_exists`, `session_delete_file`, `session_create_directory`

### **🧪 Architecture Verification Completed**

- ✅ **15/15** interface-layer resolution tests pass
- ✅ **2/2** failing tests demonstrate architectural problems (as expected)
- ✅ **100% pass rate** on Phase 1 validation tests (13/13)
- ✅ `CLISessionContextResolver` auto-detection logic tested and working
- ✅ `MCPSessionContextResolver` explicit session requirement tested and working
- ⚠️ **Integration Pending**: CLI commands still use old mixed-concerns approach

### **📁 Files Created/Modified**

**New Architecture Files**:
- `src/adapters/session-context-resolver.ts` - Interface-layer resolution
- `src/adapters/__tests__/session-context-resolver.test.ts` - Resolution tests
- `src/adapters/shared/commands/__tests__/session-context-resolution.test.ts` - Architecture tests
- `src/domain/session/session-commands.ts` - Clean session functions

**Activated Files**:
- `src/commands/mcp/index.ts` - Uncommented session tools registration
- `src/adapters/mcp/session-edit-tools.ts` - Fixed API compatibility
- `src/adapters/mcp/session-files.ts` - Fixed API compatibility

## Next Steps (Future Work):

1. **🔥 HIGH PRIORITY: Complete CLI Session Context Integration**
   - Integrate `CLISessionContextResolver` into CLI command execution flow
   - Modify CLI bridge to apply session resolution before calling shared commands
   - Remove mixed-concerns session detection from shared command layer
   - Verify CLI maintains backward-compatible auto-detection behavior

2. **🔥 HIGH PRIORITY: Implement Missing Phase 2 Search Tools**
   - Create `session_grep_search` implementation using ripgrep library
   - Create `session_file_search` implementation with fuzzy matching
   - Create `session_codebase_search` implementation with semantic search
   - Complete specifications and test cases exist in `test-verification/`

3. **📋 MEDIUM PRIORITY: Command Execution Tools**
   - Implement `session_run_command` with proper session workspace context
   - Complete reverse engineering analysis of command execution patterns

### Implementation Status by Phase (UPDATED):

1. **✅ COMPLETED**: File operations (`session_edit_file`, `session_search_replace`) + session context resolution architecture design
2. **⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETE**: Session context resolution - architecture designed and tested, CLI integration pending
3. **✅ ACTIVE**: Basic session file operations (8 tools available to MCP)
4. **❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED**: Search operations (`session_grep_search`, `session_file_search`, `session_codebase_search`) - specifications ready
5. **📋 PLANNED**: Command execution tools - analysis in progress
