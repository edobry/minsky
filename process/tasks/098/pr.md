# feat(#098): Create Shared Adapter Layer for CLI and MCP Interfaces

## Summary

This PR implements a shared adapter layer for CLI and MCP interfaces, enabling code reuse and ensuring consistency across different interfaces. The implementation includes a command registry, bridges for both interfaces, and shared implementations of Git, Tasks, Session, and Rules commands.

## Changes

### Added

- Created a shared command registry to enable code reuse between interfaces
- Implemented shared command interfaces with Zod schema validation
- Built bridges for CLI (Commander.js) and MCP interfaces
- Added unified error handling approach for all interfaces
- Created schema conversion utilities for validation and type safety
- Implemented response formatters for consistent output
- Added shared git commands implementation (commit and push)
- Added shared tasks commands implementation (status get/set)
- Added shared session commands implementation (list, get, start, dir, delete, update, approve, pr)
- Added shared rules commands implementation (list, get, create, update, search)
- Created integration examples for both CLI and MCP
- Added comprehensive test coverage for shared components

### Changed

- Refactored existing functionality to support the shared adapter pattern
- Updated integration examples to demonstrate the shared command system

### Fixed

- Fixed TypeScript errors in shared components
- Improved error handling and response format consistency

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
- Unit tests for all shared components (registry, bridges, commands)
- Integration examples for CLI and MCP interfaces
- Manual testing of command integrations

## Future Work

- Migrate additional command groups (like init)
- Add more comprehensive integration tests
- Enhance documentation for the shared adapter layer
- Improve error handling in the MCP bridge

## Checklist
