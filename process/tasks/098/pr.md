# feat(#098): Create Shared Adapter Layer for CLI and MCP Interfaces

## Summary

This PR implements a shared adapter layer that enables code reuse between the CLI and MCP interfaces. It creates a flexible command registry system with unified error handling, schema validation, and consistent response formatting. The implementation allows for progressive migration of existing interfaces to the new shared architecture.

## Changes

### Added

- **Command Registry**: Core registry for shared commands with category organization
- **Schema Bridge**: Conversion utilities between Zod schemas and CLI/MCP parameters
- **Error Handling**: Unified error handling approach for all interfaces 
- **Response Formatters**: Consistent output formatting across interfaces
- **CLI Bridge**: Adapter to connect shared commands to Commander.js
- **MCP Bridge**: Adapter to connect shared commands to the MCP server
- **Git Commands**: Implementation of shared git commands (commit, push)
- **Tasks Commands**: Implementation of shared tasks commands (status get/set)
- **Integration Examples**: Demonstration of using the shared layer in both CLI and MCP
- **Comprehensive Tests**: Test coverage for all shared components

### Changed

- Added shared components while maintaining compatibility with existing code
- Enhanced TypeScript typing to ensure type safety across the interface layer
- Refactored error handling to be more consistent between interfaces
- Fixed TypeScript errors in shared adapter components

## Testing

- Unit tests for the shared command registry
- Unit tests for shared git commands
- Unit tests for shared tasks commands
- Integration tests for CLI adapter
- End-to-end testing of the command flow from shared registry to CLI interface
