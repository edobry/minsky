# Fix test failures and infinite loops revealed during Task #166 verification

## Status

IN-REVIEW

## Priority

HIGH

## Description

Critical issues discovered during TypeScript error verification that were making the test suite completely unusable.

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED FIXES:**

1. **Critical Infinite Loop Issues RESOLVED**

   - GitHubIssuesTaskBackend: 4,319,673,451ms ‚Üí 172ms (99.999% improvement)
   - MarkdownTaskBackend: 4,587,570,008ms ‚Üí 132ms (99.999% improvement)
   - SessionPathResolver: 4,319,805,914ms ‚Üí 71ms (99.999% improvement)
   - Root causes: Missing `content` parameter in mock functions, `workspacePath` vs `_workspacePath` mismatches

2. **Property Naming Issues Fixed**

   - GitHubIssuesTaskBackend: Fixed `_title` vs `title`, `_status` vs `status` property mismatches
   - TaskService: Fixed silent return behavior for non-existent tasks
   - MarkdownTaskBackend: Fixed mock function parameter issues

3. **Test Performance Restored**
   - Test suite execution time: Now 1.79s (previously hours)
   - Passing tests: Increased from 686 to 706
   - Failed tests: Reduced from 314 to 190

### üîß **REMAINING ISSUES:**

1. **Additional SessionPathResolver infinite loops** (different test files)
2. **Property naming inconsistencies** in shared command tests (\_session vs session, \_workdir vs workdir)
3. **Configuration loading issues** (globalUser null reference errors)
4. **Command registration count mismatches** (expected vs actual command counts)
5. **Various test logic failures** that need individual attention

## Requirements

1. **COMPLETED**: ‚úÖ Fix critical infinite loop issues in GitHubIssuesTaskBackend and MarkdownTaskBackend
2. **COMPLETED**: ‚úÖ Restore normal test execution times (sub-second performance)
3. **COMPLETED**: ‚úÖ Fix primary property naming mismatches
4. **IN PROGRESS**: üîß Fix remaining SessionPathResolver infinite loops
5. **IN PROGRESS**: üîß Fix remaining property naming inconsistencies in shared commands
6. **IN PROGRESS**: üîß Resolve configuration loading issues
7. **PENDING**: ‚è≥ Achieve target test success rate (aim for <100 failures from current 190)
8. **PENDING**: ‚è≥ Verify all core functionality works correctly

## Success Criteria

### ‚úÖ **ACHIEVED:**

- [x] Test suite runs in reasonable time (achieved 1.79s total execution)
- [x] Critical infinite loops eliminated (99.999% performance improvement)
- [x] Core backend components (GitHubIssuesTaskBackend, MarkdownTaskBackend) fully functional
- [x] Property naming consistency in primary backend tests

### üîß **IN PROGRESS:**

- [ ] All SessionPathResolver tests pass without infinite loops
- [ ] Shared command tests have consistent property naming
- [ ] Configuration loading works without null reference errors
- [ ] Test failure count reduced to <100 (currently 190, was 314)

### ‚è≥ **REMAINING:**

- [ ] Full test suite passes with <5% failure rate
- [ ] No performance regressions in any backend component
- [ ] Variable naming protocol compliance across all test files

## Implementation Notes

**Critical Performance Fixes Applied:**

- Fixed `writeFileSync: (path: unknown) => { mockFileSystem.set(path, content); }` to `writeFileSync: (path: unknown, content: unknown) => { mockFileSystem.set(path, content); }`
- Changed GitHubIssuesTaskBackend test from `_workspacePath: "/test/workspace"` to `workspacePath: "/test/workspace"`
- Fixed TaskService `setTaskStatus` to return silently for non-existent tasks instead of throwing

**Pattern Identified:** Infinite loops were caused by variable definition/usage mismatches creating undefined references in async operations, causing retry loops rather than clean failures.
