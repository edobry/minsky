## Status

## Priority

## Category

ARCHITECTURE

## Context

We are transitioning from operating within existing agent loops (Cursor, Claude Code) to progressively controlling the agent workflow ourselves. Building on insights from **Task #349** (analyzing agent OODA loop patterns through chat history), we will implement a **subagent system** where specialized agents operate as MCP tools callable by the root agent.

This nested agent architecture enables:

- **Progressive control assumption** without breaking existing workflows
- **Task-based state management** using our subtask/session infrastructure
- **Context isolation** with customized tool manifests per subagent
- **Workflow orchestration** through task graph integration
- **Iterative enhancement** from simple to sophisticated implementations

## Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Create MCP tool interface** for invoking subagents from root agent context
2. **Implement agent loop** based on OODA patterns discovered in Task #349
3. **Integrate with task/session system** for state persistence and workflow management
4. **Enable context customization** with per-subagent tool and rule selection
5. **Track execution history** in conversation database for analysis and replay

### Secondary Goals

1. **Support task decomposition** into subtask graphs
2. **Enable session reuse** across related subagent invocations
3. **Provide execution visibility** through comprehensive tracing
4. **Explore workflow orchestration** with graph execution systems

## Architecture Overview

### Core Design Principles

1. **Stateful through Tasks**: Each subagent invocation creates or updates a task, providing natural state persistence
2. **Session-Based Isolation**: Subagents operate in session workspaces, maintaining separation from root agent
3. **Independent AI Inference**: Subagents make their own AI calls with customized contexts
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with minimal implementation, add sophistication iteratively
5. **Compatibility Preservation**: Maintain full compatibility with existing agent systems

### Key Components

1. **Subagent MCP Tool Interface**: Callable interface exposing subagents to root agent
2. **Agent Loop Executor**: OODA-based execution engine informed by Task #349 findings
3. **Task Integration Layer**: Links subagent execution to task/subtask system
4. **Tool Selection Service**: Provides context-aware tool manifests per subagent
5. **Conversation Database**: Tracks execution history and agent reasoning
6. **Session Manager**: Handles workspace creation and reuse for subagents
