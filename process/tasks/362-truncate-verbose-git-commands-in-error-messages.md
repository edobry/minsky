# Truncate Verbose Git Commands in Error Messages

## Context

Git commands in error messages can become extremely verbose, making error messages difficult to read and debug. This is particularly problematic with:

- Long session workspace paths (e.g., `/Users/edobry/.local/state/minsky/sessions/task362/some/deep/path/to/file.ts`)
- Complex git commands with multiple arguments and flags
- Clone URLs with authentication tokens or long repository names

**Current Examples of Verbose Error Messages:**
```
Git clone failed: Command failed with exit code 128

Command: git -C /Users/edobry/.local/state/minsky/sessions/task362/very/long/workspace/path clone https://github.com/very-long-org-name/very-long-repository-name-with-many-words.git /Users/edobry/.local/state/minsky/sessions/task362/very/long/workspace/path/destination
Working directory: /Users/edobry/.local/state/minsky/sessions/task362/very/long/workspace/path
Execution time: 5432ms
```

## Problem

The current git error handling in several places includes full commands without truncation:

1. **`src/utils/git-exec.ts:115`** - Direct error message construction with `Command: ${fullCommand}`
2. **`src/utils/git-exec.ts:80,105`** - Context passed to enhanced error templates includes full command
3. **Enhanced error templates** - May suggest verbose retry commands

This makes error messages unwieldy and harder to parse, especially in development environments with long paths.

## Solution

Implement a command truncation utility that:

1. **Truncates long paths** to show only relevant parts (e.g., `...sessions/task362/src/file.ts`)
2. **Limits overall command length** with intelligent truncation
3. **Preserves essential information** (operation, key arguments, error details)
4. **Maintains readability** while providing enough context for debugging

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a `truncateGitCommand()` utility function
2. Apply truncation in `git-exec.ts` error handling
3. Update enhanced error templates to use truncated commands
4. Add tests to verify truncation behavior
5. Ensure important debugging information is preserved

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Git commands in error messages are truncated to reasonable length (â‰¤150 chars)
- [ ] Essential information (operation, key files, error type) is preserved
- [ ] Long paths are intelligently shortened (show relevant parts)
- [ ] Error messages remain actionable and debuggable
- [ ] Tests verify truncation behavior with various command types
- [ ] No regression in error message usefulness
