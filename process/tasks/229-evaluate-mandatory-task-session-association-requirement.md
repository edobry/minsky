# Evaluate mandatory task-session association requirement

## Status

BACKLOG

## Priority

MEDIUM

## Description

Strategic evaluation of whether to mandate that all sessions must be associated with tasks

## Objective
Analyze whether Minsky should require all sessions to be associated with tasks, considering current architecture, workflows, system design, and future direction.

## Key Investigation Areas

### 1. Current Code Architecture Analysis
- Review how sessions are currently created and managed
- Analyze the relationship between sessions and tasks in the codebase
- Identify current optional vs required associations
- Document existing session lifecycle patterns

### 2. Workflow Analysis
- Examine current Minsky workflows that use sessions
- Identify workflows that operate without explicit tasks
- Analyze the session-first vs task-first workflow patterns
- Document workflow friction points and benefits

### 3. System Design Implications
- Evaluate impact on the interface-agnostic architecture
- Consider database schema and storage implications
- Analyze backward compatibility requirements
- Assess impact on session persistence and recovery

### 4. UX Considerations
- Analyze user experience for mandatory task association
- Consider friction in quick/exploratory sessions
- Evaluate impact on different user personas and use cases
- Design alternative approaches for handling ad-hoc work

### 5. Future Direction Alignment
- Consider implications for remote sessions architecture
- Evaluate alignment with AI-focused workflow direction
- Analyze impact on session sharing and collaboration features
- Consider implications for session analytics and reporting

### 6. Implementation Considerations
- Identify required code changes and migration paths
- Analyze testing requirements and complexity
- Consider rollout strategy and feature flags
- Evaluate resource requirements and timeline

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Current State Analysis Report**
   - Documentation of existing session-task relationships
   - Workflow pattern analysis
   - Technical architecture review

2. **Strategic Recommendation**
   - Clear recommendation: mandate, make optional with defaults, or maintain status quo
   - Justification based on analysis findings
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

3. **Implementation Plan** (if recommending mandate)
   - Technical changes required
   - Migration strategy for existing sessions
   - UX design for mandatory association
   - Testing and rollout approach

4. **Alternative Approaches**
   - Design options for different levels of association
   - Hybrid approaches that balance flexibility with structure
   - Configuration options for different deployment scenarios

## Success Criteria
- Comprehensive analysis of current state
- Clear strategic recommendation with solid justification
- Practical implementation approach if mandate is recommended
- Consideration of all stakeholder perspectives and use cases
