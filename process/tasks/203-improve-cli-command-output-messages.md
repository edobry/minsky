# Improve CLI Command Output Messages

## Priority

MEDIUM

## Description

Fix unclear output messages in CLI commands:

1. **Delete Command**: Add better output messages for session/task deletion operations to clearly indicate what was deleted and confirm success.

2. **Task Status Set Command**: Remove or fix the 'error defined' debug output that appears when setting task status. This appears to be debug logging that should be removed or made more informative.

3. **General Output Consistency**: Review other CLI commands for similar output issues and ensure all commands provide clear, user-friendly feedback.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Delete commands show clear success messages with details of what was deleted
- Task status set command removes debug 'error defined' output
- All CLI commands provide consistent, professional output formatting
- No debug logging appears in user-facing output unless explicitly requested
