# Task 157: Enhance Task Operations Synchronization Across Workspaces

## Status

NEW

## Priority

HIGH

## Category

ENHANCEMENT

## Problem Statement

Currently, task operations (status updates, modifications) performed in session workspaces are not properly synchronized with the main workspace or other active sessions. This creates several critical issues:

1. **Stale State**: The main workspace shows outdated task information when sessions update task status
2. **Race Conditions**: Multiple sessions can create conflicting updates that overwrite each other
3. **Inconsistent Views**: Different workspaces/sessions show different task states simultaneously
4. **Lost Updates**: Task status changes made in one session may be lost when switching contexts

This affects the markdown tasks backend implementation and undermines the reliability of the task management system.

## Requirements

### Investigation Phase

1. **Current State Analysis**

   - Document exactly how task operations currently work across main/session workspaces
   - Identify all points where task state can be modified
   - Map the data flow for task operations in different contexts
   - Catalog specific scenarios where synchronization fails

2. **Architecture Evaluation**
   Investigate and evaluate multiple approaches for solving the synchronization problem:

   **Approach A: Centralized Task Operations**

   - All task operations execute in a dedicated "task management session"
   - Session workspaces make requests to this central session for task updates
   - Evaluate feasibility, performance, and complexity

   **Approach B: Special Repository Copy**

   - Task operations work on a special copy of the repository
   - Changes are synchronized back to all active workspaces
   - Investigate git-based synchronization mechanisms
   - Consider file locking and atomic operations

   **Approach C: Event-Based Synchronization**

   - Task operations emit events that propagate to all active workspaces
   - Each workspace updates its local view based on events
   - Evaluate event delivery reliability and ordering

   **Approach D: Database-Like Backend**

   - Replace file-based task storage with a proper database backend
   - All workspaces connect to the same database instance
   - Investigate SQLite, JSON database, or in-memory solutions

   **Approach E: File Watching + Lock Coordination**

   - Use file watchers to detect task file changes
   - Implement file locking to prevent concurrent modifications
   - Evaluate cross-platform compatibility and reliability

3. **Trade-off Analysis**
   For each approach, evaluate:
   - Implementation complexity
   - Performance impact
   - Reliability and consistency guarantees
   - Cross-platform compatibility
   - Integration with existing codebase
   - User experience impact
   - Maintenance overhead

### Implementation Phase

4. **Solution Design**

   - Choose the optimal approach based on investigation findings
   - Design detailed implementation plan
   - Identify breaking changes and migration requirements
   - Plan rollback strategy

5. **Core Implementation**

   - Implement the chosen synchronization mechanism
   - Ensure backward compatibility where possible
   - Add comprehensive error handling and recovery

6. **Integration & Testing**
   - Integrate with existing task management commands
   - Test across multiple concurrent sessions
   - Verify synchronization works in all supported scenarios
   - Add integration tests for multi-workspace scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Investigation Complete**: All approaches evaluated with detailed pros/cons analysis
- [ ] **Solution Chosen**: Clear rationale provided for selected approach
- [ ] **Implementation Complete**: Task operations are properly synchronized across all workspaces
- [ ] **Race Conditions Eliminated**: No more conflicting updates or lost changes
- [ ] **Real-time Updates**: Task status changes are immediately visible in all active contexts
- [ ] **Backward Compatibility**: Existing task workflows continue to work without breaking changes
- [ ] **Performance Maintained**: No significant performance degradation in task operations
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for synchronization failures
- [ ] **Documentation Updated**: All changes documented with usage examples
- [ ] **Tests Pass**: All existing tests pass, new tests added for synchronization scenarios

## Success Metrics

- Zero instances of stale task information across workspaces
- No race conditions or lost updates in multi-session scenarios
- Task operations complete with consistent results regardless of workspace context
- User experience remains smooth with no noticeable latency increase

## Technical Considerations

- Must work with existing markdown-based task storage
- Should integrate cleanly with current session management
- Must support the full range of task operations (create, update, status change, etc.)
- Consider impact on CI/CD and automated task operations
- Ensure solution works across different operating systems

## Dependencies

- Current task management implementation
- Session management system
- File I/O and git operations
- Potentially new synchronization libraries or tools

## Estimated Effort

**Investigation Phase**: 1-2 days
**Implementation Phase**: 3-5 days
**Testing & Integration**: 1-2 days

**Total**: 5-9 days

## Notes

This is a critical infrastructure improvement that will significantly enhance the reliability of the task management system. The investigation phase is crucial - we need to thoroughly understand the problem space before committing to a solution approach.

Consider this task as foundational work that will benefit all future task management features and improvements.
