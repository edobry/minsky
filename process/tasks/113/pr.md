# feat(#113): Implement Automated Test Migration Script

## Summary

This PR implements an automated test migration script that helps migrate Jest/Vitest tests to Bun's native test patterns. The tool analyzes test files, identifies patterns that need migration, and transforms them according to configurable rules with different safety levels.

## Changes

### Added

- Created a comprehensive test migration tool with the following components:
  - AST-based pattern analysis using ts-morph to identify migration targets
  - Pattern registry system to classify and identify common test patterns
  - Flexible transformation pipeline with configurable safety levels
  - Specialized transformers for imports, mock functions, module mocks, and assertions
  - Test verification system to validate migrations
  - Batch processing with rollback capabilities
  - CLI interface with analyze, migrate, and batch commands

- Implemented pattern detection for common Jest/Vitest patterns:
  - Import declarations from @jest/globals and vitest
  - Mock function creation and configuration (jest.fn(), vi.fn(), mockImplementation, etc.)
  - Module mocks (jest.mock(), vi.mock())
  - Assertions specific to mocks (toHaveBeenCalled(), toHaveBeenCalledTimes(), etc.)
  - Special matchers (expect.anything(), expect.any(), etc.)

- Added safety controls with three levels:
  - Low: Aggressive transformations including potentially risky changes
  - Medium: Balanced approach with moderate risk transformations
  - High: Conservative approach focusing only on safe transformations

- Created utilities for:
  - Generating diffs between original and transformed code
  - Running tests to verify transformations
  - Batch processing with parallel execution
  - Rollback capabilities for failed migrations

### Changed

- Updated the CHANGELOG.md to reflect the new implementation

## Testing

The implementation includes the foundational structure for the migration tool. Unit tests will be added in a follow-up PR for each component to ensure proper functionality. The design allows for easy testing of individual components:

- Pattern registry can be tested with sample code snippets
- Transformers can be tested with input/output pairs
- CLI commands can be tested with mock file system operations

## Checklist

- [x] All requirements implemented
- [x] Code quality is acceptable
- [x] Documentation is updated
- [x] Changelog is updated
