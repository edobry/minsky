# Detailed Implementation Plan for Task #113

## 1. Preparation and Analysis

1. **Research and Technology Selection**

   - [x] Evaluate TypeScript AST parsers (TypeScript Compiler API, ts-morph, etc.) for parsing test files
   - [x] Review existing codemods and migration tools for inspiration
   - [x] Analyze outputs from Task #110 (Test Inventory) to identify common patterns for migration
   - [x] Study the Core Mock Compatibility Layer from Task #111 to ensure alignment

2. **Test Pattern Analysis Framework**
   - [x] Create a pattern registry system that can identify:
     - [x] Jest/Vitest imports (`import { jest } from "@jest/globals"`, etc.)
     - [x] Mock function declarations (`jest.fn()`, `vi.fn()`)
     - [x] Module mocks (`jest.mock()`, `vi.mock()`)
     - [x] Assertion patterns (`expect(x).toBe()`, matchers, etc.)
     - [x] Setup/teardown hooks (`beforeEach()`, `afterEach()`)
   - [x] Build pattern matching utilities with context awareness
   - [x] Implement pattern classification based on migration complexity

## 2. Transformation Engine

1. **Core Transformation Infrastructure**

   - [x] Create the base transformation engine with AST manipulation capabilities
   - [x] Implement a transformation pipeline for sequential modifications
   - [x] Build a change tracking system to record all transformations
   - [x] Create formatting preservation logic to maintain code style

2. **Transformation Rule Implementation**

   - [x] Implement import transformations (Jest/Vitest → Bun or compatibility layer)
   - [x] Build mock function transformations:
     - [x] `jest.fn()` → `mock()` or compatibility layer equivalent
     - [x] `mockReturnValue()` → appropriate Bun equivalent
     - [x] `mockImplementation()` → Bun equivalent
   - [x] Create module mock transformations:
     - [x] `jest.mock()` → `mock.module()` or compatibility equivalent
     - [x] Auto-mocking functionality
   - [x] Implement assertion transformations:
     - [x] Convert assertion matchers to Bun equivalents
     - [x] Transform asymmetric matchers to compatibility layer
   - [ ] Build utility function transformations:
     - [ ] Timer mocks
     - [ ] Custom matchers
     - [ ] Test helpers

3. **Transformation Validation**
   - [x] Implement syntax validation for transformed code
   - [x] Add semantic validation to ensure transformations maintain test intent
   - [x] Create snapshot-based validation for before/after comparisons

## 3. Command-Line Interface

1. **Core CLI Framework**

   - [x] Set up a command-line framework with subcommands
   - [x] Implement configuration file support (for persistent settings)
   - [x] Create a user-friendly interface with clear error messages
   - [x] Add logging and verbose output options

2. **Analysis Commands**

   - [x] Implement `analyze` command for test pattern identification
   - [x] Add file/directory scanning capabilities
   - [x] Create detailed analysis reports with pattern statistics
   - [x] Add visualization options for complex pattern relationships

3. **Migration Commands**

   - [x] Create `migrate` command with appropriate options
   - [x] Implement `--preview` mode for displaying changes without applying
   - [x] Add `--safety-level` option for controlling migration aggressiveness
   - [x] Implement interactive confirmation for changes

4. **Batch Processing & Verification**
   - [x] Add batch processing support for multiple files/directories
   - [x] Implement test execution for pre/post migration verification
   - [x] Create rollback capabilities for failed migrations
   - [x] Build comprehensive reporting system for migration outcomes

## 4. Integration and Documentation

1. **Test Utility Integration**

   - [x] Integrate with Task #111 (Core Mock Compatibility Layer)
   - [x] Ensure alignment with patterns from Task #112 (Test Utility Documentation)
   - [ ] Create extensible plugin system for custom transformations
   - [x] Build integration with existing test runners

2. **Documentation and Examples**

   - [x] Create comprehensive tool documentation
   - [x] Develop guides for common migration scenarios
   - [x] Build a pattern reference with before/after examples
   - [ ] Document troubleshooting strategies for common issues

3. **Verification and Testing**
   - [ ] Create an extensive test suite for the tool itself
   - [ ] Implement integration tests with sample test files
   - [x] Document verification procedures for migrations
   - [x] Build quality metrics for migration success
