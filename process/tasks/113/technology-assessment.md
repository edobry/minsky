# Technology Assessment for Test Migration Script

## AST Parser Options

### 1. TypeScript Compiler API

- **Pros**: Native TypeScript support, provides complete type information, direct access to TypeScript's internal APIs
- **Cons**: Steep learning curve, complex API, limited documentation for transformation use cases
- **Best for**: Deep TypeScript integration, complex type-aware transformations

### 2. ts-morph

- **Pros**: High-level abstraction over TypeScript Compiler API, simpler API, good documentation
- **Cons**: Additional dependency, may not expose all low-level TypeScript features
- **Best for**: TypeScript transformations with a balance of power and ease of use

### 3. Babel + TypeScript Plugin

- **Pros**: Widely used, extensive documentation, plugin ecosystem
- **Cons**: Less TypeScript-native than other options, may not handle all TypeScript features
- **Best for**: Cross-compatibility with JavaScript and TypeScript

### 4. jscodeshift + TypeScript Support

- **Pros**: Purpose-built for codemods, collection-based API for easy transformations
- **Cons**: Not TS-native, less type awareness
- **Best for**: Batch transformations with simple patterns

## Transformation Strategy

### Full AST Transformation vs. Targeted Search & Replace

1. **Full AST Transformation**

   - **Pros**: Complete understanding of code semantics, can handle complex transformations
   - **Cons**: Higher complexity, more resource-intensive
   - **Best for**: Complex pattern migrations, type-dependent transformations

2. **Targeted Search & Replace**

   - **Pros**: Simpler implementation, faster for basic patterns
   - **Cons**: May miss context-dependent cases, less robust
   - **Best for**: Simple, well-defined patterns

3. **Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**
   - Using AST to identify pattern locations, but applying targeted transformations
   - Maintains formatting and preserves surrounding code
   - Balances accuracy and simplicity

## Test Runner Integration

### 1. Bun Test Runner

- Need to integrate with Bun's test runner for verification
- May require custom test extraction and execution

### 2. Current Jest/Vitest Usage

- Need to understand current test setup for proper migration
- Should identify all test configuration to ensure completeness

## Existing Migration Tools to Consider

1. **jest-codemods**: For migrating between test frameworks

   - Example of pattern-based transformation
   - Limited to specific framework migrations

2. **ts-migrate**: Microsoft's TypeScript migration tool

   - Example of comprehensive codebase migration
   - Good reference for managing complex transformations

3. **Dropbox's TypeScript AST Viewer**
   - Helpful for visualizing AST structure
   - Useful for pattern identification

## Recommended Technology Stack

Based on our project requirements, the following technology stack is recommended:

1. **Parser**: ts-morph

   - Provides good balance of TypeScript integration and ease of use
   - Well-documented and actively maintained
   - Simplifies common AST operations while providing access to compiler when needed

2. **Transformation Strategy**: Hybrid with pattern registry

   - Create a registry of patterns to identify
   - Use AST for pattern identification
   - Apply targeted transformations with before/after validation

3. **CLI Framework**: commander.js or yargs

   - Well-established, simple API
   - Good support for subcommands and options

4. **Testing Approach**: Snapshot-based verification

   - Create snapshots of tests before and after transformation
   - Compare execution results for validation

5. **Reporting**: Custom JSON-based reporting with console visualization
   - Track migration success rates
   - Identify pattern occurrences
   - Visualize migration progress
