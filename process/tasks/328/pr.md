# feat(#328): Implement recursive command nesting for arbitrary depth

## Summary

This PR implements recursive command nesting support to eliminate "Complex command nesting not yet supported" warnings and enable arbitrary depth command hierarchies in the CLI interface.

## Changes

### Added

- **Recursive command nesting implementation**: New `addNestedCommandRecursive` method that can handle command names with 3+ words
- **Deep command hierarchy support**: Commands like `core AI Models Refresh` now work with proper nesting instead of flat structure
- **TypeScript type safety improvements**: Added proper null checking for command name handling

### Changed

- **Replaced warning with implementation**: `addComplexNestedCommand` now uses recursive logic instead of logging warnings and falling back to flat commands
- **Improved command organization**: Commands are now properly nested at arbitrary depths with intermediate command groups

### Fixed

- **Eliminated CLI warnings**: No more "Complex command nesting not yet supported" messages during CLI startup
- **Command nesting limitations**: Removed the artificial restriction on command depth in the CLI interface

## Testing

- ✅ CLI builds and starts without warnings
- ✅ All existing command functionality preserved
- ✅ Deep nesting commands (3+ levels) now work properly
- ✅ No regression in existing 1-2 level command nesting
- ✅ All linting checks pass
- ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds

## Technical Details

The implementation uses a recursive approach with a command groups map to track intermediate commands at each nesting level. This ensures that:

1. **Shared intermediate commands**: Multiple commands sharing the same prefix path reuse intermediate command groups
2. **Proper command hierarchy**: Commands are nested correctly regardless of depth
3. **Type safety**: All edge cases (empty names, undefined parents) are handled safely
4. **Performance**: Efficient lookup and creation of intermediate commands using Map-based caching

## Breaking Changes

None - this is a pure enhancement that maintains backward compatibility with all existing command structures.

## Related Issues

Fixes the "Complex command nesting not yet supported" warnings identified during the CLI command registration audit.
