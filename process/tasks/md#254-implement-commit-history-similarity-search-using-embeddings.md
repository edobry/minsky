## Description

# Implement Commit History Similarity Search Using Embeddings

## Context

As development workflows become more complex and git repositories grow larger, developers need intelligent ways to:

1. **Find related commits** - Discover commits that made similar changes or addressed related issues
2. **Understand code evolution** - Trace how specific features or components evolved over time
3. **Identify patterns** - Find commits that follow similar patterns or implement related functionality
4. **Support debugging** - Find commits that might be related to current bugs or issues
5. **Enhance PR workflows** - Identify relevant commits when reviewing or creating pull requests
6. **Support session workflows** - Find commits relevant to current session work or task context
7. **Prevent duplicate work** - Identify if similar changes have already been made

This task implements semantic similarity search for git commits using embeddings, leveraging the same embedding approach from Task #179 and complementing the task similarity search from Task #253.

## Dependencies

1. **Task #179**: Builds on the embeddings/RAG investigation for the same embedding technology and architecture
2. **Task #253**: Shares embedding infrastructure and similarity search patterns with task similarity search
3. **Task #160**: Requires AI completion backend for embedding generation
4. **GitService**: Integrates with existing git functionality in the domain layer

## Objective

Implement a comprehensive commit history similarity search system that uses embeddings to find semantically similar commits, enabling intelligent code exploration, debugging support, and enhanced development workflows.

## Core Features

### 1. Commit Similarity Search

**`minsky git similar-commits <commit-hash>`**

- Find commits similar to a given commit
- Analyze commit message, changed files, and diff content
- Configurable similarity threshold and result ranking
- Support for filtering by author, date range, or file patterns

**`minsky git find-commits <query>`**

- Search for commits similar to a natural language query
- Useful for finding commits by semantic meaning rather than exact text
- Support for both commit message and code change queries

### 2. Feature Evolution Tracking

**`minsky git trace-feature <query>`**

- Trace how a specific feature or component evolved over time
- Find all commits related to a particular functionality
- Chronological view of feature development
- Integration with file and directory patterns

**`minsky git related-changes <file-path>`**

- Find commits that made similar changes to a specific file
- Useful for understanding change patterns and debugging
- Support for analyzing change types (additions, deletions, refactors)

### 3. Pattern Recognition

**`minsky git find-patterns [--type=refactor|bugfix|feature]`**

- Identify commits that follow similar patterns
- Group commits by change type and semantic similarity
- Useful for understanding development practices and code quality
- Support for custom pattern definitions

**`minsky git similar-fixes <commit-hash>`**

- Find commits that implemented similar bug fixes
- Analyze fix patterns and solution approaches
- Useful for debugging and code review workflows

### 4. Workflow Integration

**`minsky git session-commits [--session-id=<id>]`**

- Find commits relevant to current session work
- Integrate with session management and task context
- Support for filtering by task relevance and work context

**`minsky git pr-related-commits <pr-number>`**

- Find commits relevant to a specific pull request
- Support for both incoming and historical PR analysis
- Integration with PR workflow and review process

## Technical Implementation

### Embedding Generation

Building on Tasks #179 and #253's embedding approach:

1. **Commit Content Extraction:**

   - Extract embeddings from commit messages, file changes, and diff content
   - Handle different types of changes (code, documentation, configuration)
   - Support for multi-file commits and complex change patterns

2. **Structured Analysis:**

   - Separate embeddings for commit messages vs. code changes
   - Weighted similarity based on change type and scope
   - Support for filtering by commit attributes (author, date, files)

3. **Incremental Processing:**
   - Process new commits automatically as they're created
   - Efficient batch processing for existing commit history
   - Support for repository-wide and session-specific indexing

### Vector Storage and Search

1. **Commit Vector Database:**

   - Use same vector database infrastructure as Tasks #179 and #253
   - Efficient storage and retrieval of commit embeddings
   - Support for large repository histories (10k+ commits)

2. **Multi-Modal Similarity:**

   - Combine commit message similarity with code change similarity
   - Configurable weights for different similarity dimensions
   - Support for filtering by file types, change patterns, or metadata

3. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Indexing strategies for large commit histories
   - Efficient similarity search with caching
   - Background processing for repository analysis

### Git Integration

1. **Repository Analysis:**

   - Integration with existing GitService for repository access
   - Support for both local and remote repository analysis
   - Efficient processing of git log and diff information

2. **Session Context:**

   - Integration with session management for context-aware search
   - Automatic filtering based on current session and task context
   - Support for session-specific commit relevance scoring

3. **Workflow Enhancement:**
   - Integration with PR workflows and branch management
   - Support for commit recommendation during development
   - Context-aware suggestions based on current work

## Use Cases

### 1. Development and Debugging

```bash
# Find commits that made similar changes to current work
minsky git similar-commits HEAD~1

# Search for commits related to authentication
minsky git find-commits "authentication login security"

# Find commits that fixed similar bugs
minsky git similar-fixes abc123 --type=bugfix

# Trace how authentication feature evolved
minsky git trace-feature "user authentication" --since="6 months ago"
```

### 2. Code Review and PR Workflows

```bash
# Find commits relevant to current PR
minsky git pr-related-commits 150

# Find similar refactoring commits for reference
minsky git find-patterns --type=refactor --file-pattern="*.ts"

# Find commits that made similar changes to specific files
minsky git related-changes src/auth/login.ts --threshold=0.7
```

### 3. Session and Task Context

```bash
# Find commits relevant to current session work
minsky git session-commits --current

# Find commits related to specific task
minsky git find-commits "task #123" --include-code-changes

# Find commits that might be blocking current work
minsky git similar-commits $(git rev-parse HEAD) --exclude-merged
```

### 4. Repository Analysis and Maintenance

```bash
# Analyze commit patterns in the repository
minsky git find-patterns --analyze --export=report.json

# Find duplicate or similar commits
minsky git find-duplicates --threshold=0.9

# Generate commit relationship map
minsky git analyze-commit-relationships --visualize
```
