## **🔥 Critical Issues Summary**

1. **CLI Command Still Completely Broken**: CLI bridge not generating rules.generate command despite it being registered
2. **NEW REGRESSION: Session Commands Missing**: Main merge broke session command registration, causing template system failures
3. **Template System Now Failing**: Cannot generate any rules due to missing command references
4. **CLI Bridge Integration Issues**: Commands exist in shared registry but not exposed via CLI
5. **Configuration Service Missing**: Still no access to configuration system

## **✅ What Works**
- Core template system logic
- Template loading and parsing
- Command generation algorithms
- Shared command registry (partially - some commands missing)

## **❌ What's Broken**
- CLI command execution (CLI bridge issue)
- Template system rule generation (missing session commands)
- Session command registration (main merge regression)
- End-to-end integration
- Configuration service access

## **📝 Post-Merge Analysis**

**Merging main branch CREATED NEW ISSUES rather than resolving existing ones:**

### Issues Fixed by Merge:
- ✅ ESLint configuration and dependencies
- ✅ Jest to Bun mock syntax conversion

### New Issues Created by Merge:
- ❌ Session commands missing from shared registry (session.start, session.list, etc.)
- ❌ Template system now fails to generate any rules
- ❌ Command reference validation failing

### Issues That Persist:
- ❌ CLI bridge not exposing generate command
- ❌ Configuration service integration
- ❌ End-to-end CLI functionality

**Recommendation**: The template system was working before the merge. The main integration introduced command registry regressions that need investigation and resolution.
