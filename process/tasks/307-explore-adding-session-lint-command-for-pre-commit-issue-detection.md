# Explore adding session lint command for pre-commit issue detection

## Status

BACKLOG

## Priority

MEDIUM

## Description

Research and design a `session lint` command that can detect various issues in a session workspace before attempting to commit changes. This would help catch problems early in the development workflow.

## Scope of Research

### Command Purpose
- Run comprehensive linting and validation checks on session workspace
- Detect issues that could cause commit failures or code quality problems
- Provide actionable feedback to developers before they attempt to commit

### Areas to Investigate

#### 1. Types of Checks to Include
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, TypeScript compiler errors, style issues
- **Test Validation**: Ensure tests pass, check for test syntax issues
- **Import/Export Issues**: Circular dependencies, missing imports, unused imports
- **File Structure**: Missing files, incorrect file locations, naming conventions
- **Git Issues**: Uncommitted changes, merge conflicts, branch status
- **Project Integrity**: Package.json validation, dependency issues
- **Minsky-Specific**: Task completion status, session state validation

#### 2. Integration Points
- How should this integrate with existing session workflow?
- Should it run automatically before certain operations?
- How should it interact with existing linting tools?
- What about CI/CD pipeline integration?

#### 3. User Experience Design
- Command syntax and options (`minsky session lint [options]`)
- Output formatting (summary vs detailed, JSON output for tooling)
- Exit codes for programmatic usage
- Interactive vs non-interactive modes

#### 4. Performance Considerations
- How to make linting fast enough for frequent use
- Incremental linting (only changed files)
- Parallel execution of different check types
- Caching strategies

#### 5. Configuration Options
- Allow users to configure which checks to run
- Project-specific linting rules
- Integration with existing linting configurations (.eslintrc, etc.)

### Research Questions

1. **Existing Tools**: What linting tools are already available in the ecosystem?
2. **User Workflow**: How would this fit into typical development patterns?
3. **Automation**: Should this be automatically run before commits/PRs?
4. **Extensibility**: How can users add custom checks?
5. **Error Recovery**: How should the command help users fix detected issues?

### Deliverables

1. **Analysis Document**: Comprehensive research findings
2. **Design Proposal**: Command interface and architecture design
3. **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step development approach
4. **Prototype**: Basic working implementation if feasible
5. **Integration Strategy**: How to add this to existing Minsky workflow

### Success Criteria

- Clear understanding of user needs and use cases
- Well-defined command interface and behavior
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Implementation roadmap with effort estimates
- User adoption strategy

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Command Interface**
   - Implement `minsky session lint` command in CLI adapter
   - Support common flags: `--fix`, `--json`, `--verbose`, `--fast`
   - Provide clear exit codes (0=success, 1=warnings, 2=errors)
   - Include help documentation and examples

2. **Core Linting Capabilities**
   - TypeScript compilation check
   - ESLint integration (respect existing .eslintrc config)
   - Import/export validation
   - Basic git status validation
   - Test syntax validation (without running tests)

3. **Output Requirements**
   - Human-readable summary with file/line references
   - JSON output option for tool integration
   - Color-coded output (errors=red, warnings=yellow, success=green)
   - Performance metrics (time taken, files checked)

4. **Integration Requirements**
   - Work within existing session workspace context
   - Respect gitignore and linting ignore files
   - Support both TypeScript and JavaScript projects
   - Handle monorepo and single-package projects

### Technical Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Complete basic lint check in under 10 seconds for typical session
   - Support incremental checking (only changed files)
   - Parallel execution where possible

2. **Extensibility**
   - Plugin architecture for custom checks
   - Configuration file support (`.minsky-lint.json`)
   - Integration with existing project linting setup

3. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation when tools unavailable
   - Clear error messages for configuration issues
   - Recovery suggestions for common problems
