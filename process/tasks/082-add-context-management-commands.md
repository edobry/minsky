# Add Context Management Commands for Environment-Agnostic AI Collaboration

## Context

Modern AI agents like those used in Minsky rely heavily on prompt engineering and context management. Currently, there's no way to analyze, visualize, or manipulate this context, making it difficult to debug issues or optimize prompts. Additionally, understanding context utilization across different LLM models is crucial for performance optimization and cost management.

**Key Challenge**: Minsky should enable collaboration with AI agents that aren't bound to specific development environments like Cursor. To achieve this capability - creating environment-agnostic agents with capabilities comparable to human engineers - we need foundational tools that allow us to understand, manipulate, and transfer context between different environments and models.

The "salient rule loading" workflow (where rules are dynamically loaded based on relevance) requires tools to simulate and test this behavior. Engineers need visibility into how much context is being used and how effectively it's being managed.

## Goals

1. Create a foundation for environment-agnostic AI collaboration
2. Enable context portability between different AI agents and environments
3. Provide tools for understanding and optimizing context usage
4. Support development of AI agents that can function effectively across any development environment

## Requirements

1. **Model Awareness and Environment Abstraction**

   - Create an abstraction layer for model information that can:
     - Identify which model is being used for a given session
     - Retrieve model specifications (context window size, token limits, capabilities)
     - Support both online API-based models and local inference models
     - Allow for model simulation/emulation for testing
     - Define environment-agnostic interfaces for context transportation

2. **Context Analysis Commands**

   - `minsky context analyze` - Analyze the current context and provide metrics
     - Show total tokens used/available
     - Breakdown of context usage by category (rules, code, conversation history)
     - Identify potential optimization opportunities
     - Highlight transportable vs. environment-specific context elements

3. **Context Visualization**

   - `minsky context visualize` - Generate a visual representation of context usage
     - Command-line based visualization for quick reference
     - Optional output to structured formats (JSON, CSV) for further analysis
     - Visualize context boundaries and portability across environments

4. **Rule Simulation**

   - `minsky context simulate-rules` - Test rule loading behavior
     - Allow specification of which rules to include
     - Show how rules would be loaded in a real scenario
     - Calculate token usage impact of different rule combinations
     - Simulate rule transportation across different environments
     - **Note**: For practical AI-powered rule selection, see task 182 which provides `minsky context suggest-rules` for immediate rule recommendation needs

5. **Context Management and Collaboration**
   - `minsky context prune` - Optimize context by removing less relevant content
   - `minsky context prioritize` - Reorder context elements based on importance
   - `minsky context export` - Export context in a format that can be used by other agents
   - `minsky context import` - Import context from other agents or environments

## Dependencies

- **Task 182**: AI-Powered Rule Suggestion (complementary - provides practical rule selection functionality that complements this task's simulation capabilities)

## Implementation Steps

1. [ ] **Research and Design**

   - [ ] Research token counting libraries and approaches for different models
   - [ ] Design model abstraction layer that works with various LLM providers
   - [ ] Create data structures for representing context elements and their metadata
   - [ ] Design the command interface and options
   - [ ] Research context portability formats and standards

2. [ ] **Model Awareness Implementation**

   - [ ] Create a ModelInfo interface and concrete implementations
   - [ ] Implement detection logic for identifying the active model
   - [ ] Build adapters for online vs. local models
   - [ ] Add model specification repository (context sizes, capabilities)
   - [ ] Implement environment detection and abstraction

3. [ ] **Core Context Analysis**

   - [ ] Implement token counting functions for different model types
   - [ ] Create analysis algorithms for context breakdown
   - [ ] Develop recommendation engine for context optimization
   - [ ] Build context portability analyzer

4. [ ] **Command Implementation**

   - [ ] Implement `context analyze` command
   - [ ] Implement `context visualize` command
   - [ ] Implement `context simulate-rules` command (focus on testing/debugging rather than selection - practical selection is handled by task 182)
   - [ ] Implement `context prune` command
   - [ ] Implement `context prioritize` command
   - [ ] Implement `context export` command
   - [ ] Implement `context import` command

5. [ ] **Testing**

   - [ ] Create unit tests for token counting and analysis
   - [ ] Develop integration tests for model detection
   - [ ] Test with various rule combinations and context sizes
   - [ ] Performance testing for large contexts
   - [ ] Cross-environment context transfer testing

6. [ ] **Documentation**
   - [ ] Add command documentation and examples
   - [ ] Create guides for context optimization
   - [ ] Document model specifications and limitations
   - [ ] Create tutorials for cross-environment agent collaboration

## Verification

- [ ] Commands correctly identify and report on the model in use
- [ ] Token counting is accurate across different model types
- [ ] Rule simulation correctly predicts loading behavior
- [ ] Context analysis provides actionable insights
- [ ] Commands work in all supported environments (local and API-based)
- [ ] Context can be successfully transferred between different environments
- [ ] AI agents can collaborate effectively using transported context
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (specify metrics)

## Technical Considerations

- **Model Abstraction**: We'll need a flexible abstraction that works with different model providers and can be extended as new models emerge.
- **Environment Abstraction**: Create a layer that abstracts away environment-specific details to enable true portability.
- **Token Counting**: Different models have different tokenization algorithms; we'll need to account for this.
- **Performance**: Context analysis should be efficient and not significantly impact workflow.
- **API Integration**: For online models, we'll need to integrate with provider APIs to get accurate model information.
- **Context Portability**: Define standard formats for exporting/importing context that maintain semantic meaning.
- **Collaboration Protocols**: Define how agents can share context efficiently while maintaining coherence.
- **Extensibility**: The system should be designed to accommodate future models and development environments.
