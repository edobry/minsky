# feat(#92,#95): Add session PR command and fix git prepare-pr branch naming issues

## Summary

This PR implements two related improvements to the pull request workflow:

1. Adds a new `session pr` command that automatically creates PR branches for sessions
2. Fixes branch naming issues in the `git prepare-pr` command to consistently use the git branch name

Together, these changes enhance the PR workflow by providing a simpler, more consistent interface for preparing PRs and ensuring branch names are consistent regardless of whether a title is provided.

## Changes

### Added

- New `session pr` command in the session command group that:
  - Automatically detects the current session context
  - Uses the git branch name for PR branch naming
  - Updates task status to IN-REVIEW if associated with a task
  - Provides clear user feedback on success or failure
- Added sessionPrFromParams domain function for interface-agnostic PR creation
- Added tests for the new session PR command

### Changed

- Modified the `git prepare-pr` command to always use the git branch name for PR branch naming
- Updated PR workflow documentation to accurately reflect available commands
- Improved logging in the PR branch creation process

### Fixed

- Fixed inconsistent branch naming in `git prepare-pr` command when a title parameter is provided
- Ensured PR branch names are always in the format `pr/<branch-name>` regardless of title parameter
- Maintained separation between branch naming (from git) and descriptive commit messages (from title parameter)

## Testing

- Added unit tests for the new `session pr` command
- Manually tested PR branch creation with both commands to verify branch naming consistency
- Verified that task status is correctly updated to IN-REVIEW when using the new command

## Checklist

- [x] All requirements implemented
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] Code quality is acceptable
