# Review Session PR Workflow Architecture

**Status:** TODO
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Dependencies:** Task #176 (Comprehensive Session Database Architecture Fix)

## Problem

The `session pr` workflow has evolved organically and needs architectural review to ensure it makes sense in the context of the broader Minsky workflow. Several questions have emerged:

**Note**: This task focuses on **workflow design** questions. The underlying session database architecture issues (multiple databases, conflicting error messages) are addressed in **Task #176**.

## Architecture Questions

### 1. Session Update Integration

**Current**: `session pr` automatically runs `session update` before creating PR
**Questions**:

- Should this be automatic or optional?
- What happens when session changes are already merged to main?
- How should merge conflicts be handled?
- Is the `--no-update` flag the right solution?

### 2. Workflow Structure Analysis

The current `session pr` process follows these steps:

1. Validate session workspace and branch
2. Auto-detect session name from workspace
3. Extract task ID from session name
4. **Run session update** (merge latest main)
5. Prepare PR branch and push
6. Return to session branch
7. Update task status (unless `--no-status-update`)

**Questions**:

- Is step 4 (session update) always necessary?
- Should it be skippable by default in certain scenarios?
- How does this integrate with the broader git workflow?

### 3. Error Handling and User Experience

**Current Issues**:

- Confusing error messages when session changes already merged
- Complex resolution instructions that may not apply
- User confusion about when to use which flags

### 4. Integration with Minsky Git Workflow

**Questions**:

- How does `session pr` relate to `git pr` command?
- Should they be consolidated?
- What's the intended workflow for different scenarios?

## Investigation Areas

### A. Analyze Current Usage Patterns

- Review how `session pr` is actually used
- Identify common failure scenarios
- Document expected vs actual workflows

### B. Compare with Git PR Command

- Understand differences between `session pr` and `git pr`
- Identify overlapping functionality
- Determine if consolidation makes sense

### C. Review Error Scenarios

- Session changes already in main
- Merge conflicts during update
- Missing session context
- Invalid branch states

### D. Evaluate Auto-Update Logic

- When is session update actually needed?
- Can we auto-detect when to skip it?
- Should default behavior change based on context?

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Clear documentation of intended workflow
- [ ] Simplified and consistent user experience
- [ ] Proper handling of edge cases
- [ ] Integration strategy with broader git workflow
- [ ] Recommendations for architectural improvements

## Deliverables

1. **Workflow Design Analysis Document**

   - Current state assessment of workflow patterns
   - Identified workflow design issues and gaps
   - Recommended workflow improvements

2. **Workflow Documentation**

   - Step-by-step intended workflows for different scenarios
   - User experience guidelines
   - Integration patterns with other commands

3. **Implementation Plan**
   - Specific workflow design changes needed
   - User experience improvements
   - Testing requirements for workflow scenarios

## Coordination with Task #176

This task **depends on** Task #176 (Comprehensive Session Database Architecture Fix) being completed first, as it will:

- Resolve the technical database issues causing conflicting error messages
- Provide a stable foundation for workflow design decisions
- Eliminate the root causes of current workflow problems

Once Task #176 is complete, this task will focus on optimizing the **user experience** and **workflow patterns** rather than fixing technical database issues.
