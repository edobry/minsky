# Task #361: Explore Automated Session Sync Workflow on PR Merge

## Status

TODO

## Priority

HIGH

## Summary

Explore the concept of automatically creating work items (distinct from user tasks) to merge `main` into active session branches when PRs are merged. This system would bridge PR completion with ongoing session work, ensuring sessions stay synchronized with the latest main branch changes.

## Context & Dependencies

### Prerequisites

- **Task #239 (Phase 2)**: Task dependencies and graphs provide foundation for automated work items
- **Task #175**: AI-powered task management offers intelligent relationship analysis
- **Existing session management**: Current session workflow and branch management
- **PR workflow system**: Current PR creation and merge processes

### Conceptual Foundation

This explores a new category of work items that are:
- **System-generated** (not human-prompted tasks)
- **Event-driven** (triggered by PR merges)
- **Workflow-oriented** (focused on maintaining system state)
- **AI-enhanced** (intelligent relationship detection and conflict prediction)

## Problem Statement

When PRs are merged to `main`, active session branches can become outdated, leading to:

1. **Merge conflicts** when sessions are eventually merged
2. **Lost context** about what changes might affect ongoing work
3. **Manual overhead** of keeping sessions synchronized
4. **Missed opportunities** for early conflict detection and resolution

Current workflow requires manual session maintenance, creating friction in development flow.

## Proposed Solution: Automated Session Sync Orchestration

### 1. Work Item Classification System

Introduce a new category of work items distinct from user tasks:

```typescript
interface WorkItem {
  id: string;
  type: "user-task" | "system-action" | "ai-suggestion";
  source: "manual" | "pr-merge" | "ai-analysis" | "scheduled";
  
  // Core work item data
  title: string;
  description: string;
  status: WorkItemStatus;
  priority: WorkItemPriority;
  
  // System action specific fields
  automation?: {
    executable: boolean;           // Can this be auto-executed?
    requiresConfirmation: boolean; // Needs human approval?
    retryable: boolean;           // Can retry on failure?
    prerequisites: string[];       // Other work items that must complete first
  };
  
  // Context and relationships
  context: {
    triggerEvent?: PRMergeEvent;   // What triggered this work item
    affectedSessions?: string[];   // Sessions this affects
    relatedTasks?: string[];      // Related user tasks
    riskLevel?: "low" | "medium" | "high"; // AI-assessed risk
  };
  
  // Execution tracking
  execution?: {
    attempts: number;
    lastAttempt?: Date;
    errors?: string[];
    logs?: string[];
  };
}
```

### 2. PR Merge Event Processing

#### 2.1 Event Detection and Analysis

```typescript
interface PRMergeEvent {
  prId: string;
  prTitle: string;
  baseBranch: string;        // Usually 'main'
  mergeBranch: string;       // Feature branch that was merged
  mergeCommit: string;
  changedFiles: string[];
  
  // AI-enhanced analysis
  analysis: {
    impactAssessment: "low" | "medium" | "high";
    affectedAreas: string[];           // Code areas affected
    potentialConflicts: string[];      // Predicted conflict areas
    relatedSessions: SessionRelation[];
  };
}

interface SessionRelation {
  sessionId: string;
  relationshipType: "explicit" | "inferred" | "file-overlap" | "dependency-based";
  relationshipStrength: number;  // 0-1 confidence score
  reasoning: string;             // AI explanation of relationship
}
```

#### 2.2 Backend-Specific Event Detection

**GitHub Backend:**
```typescript
// Use GitHub webhooks for real-time PR merge detection
interface GitHubWebhookHandler {
  onPullRequestMerged(event: GitHubPREvent): Promise<WorkItem[]>;
  
  // Rich GitHub context available
  analyzeRelatedSessions(pr: GitHubPullRequest): Promise<SessionRelation[]>;
  detectFileOverlaps(changedFiles: string[], sessions: Session[]): SessionRelation[];
}
```

**Local Backend:**
```typescript
// Git hook or polling-based detection
interface LocalEventDetector {
  // Option 1: Git hooks (post-merge, post-receive)
  setupGitHooks(repoPath: string): void;
  
  // Option 2: Periodic polling of git log
  pollForMerges(lastCheck: Date): Promise<PRMergeEvent[]>;
  
  // Option 3: Manual trigger
  manualMergeDetection(mergeCommit: string): Promise<PRMergeEvent>;
}
```

### 3. AI-Enhanced Session Relationship Detection

```typescript
interface SessionRelationshipAnalyzer {
  // Analyze which sessions are affected by PR changes
  analyzeSessionImpact(
    prEvent: PRMergeEvent, 
    activeSessions: Session[]
  ): Promise<SessionRelation[]>;
  
  // Predict potential merge conflicts
  predictConflicts(
    sessionBranch: string, 
    mainChanges: string[]
  ): Promise<ConflictPrediction[]>;
  
  // Assess merge complexity and risk
  assessMergeRisk(
    session: Session, 
    prEvent: PRMergeEvent
  ): Promise<MergeRiskAssessment>;
}

interface ConflictPrediction {
  file: string;
  conflictType: "content" | "structure" | "dependency";
  confidence: number;
  suggestedResolution?: string;
}
```

### 4. Work Item Generation Strategies

#### 4.1 Automatic Sync Work Items

```typescript
// Generate work items for different sync scenarios
function generateSyncWorkItems(
  prEvent: PRMergeEvent,
  sessionRelations: SessionRelation[]
): WorkItem[] {
  
  return sessionRelations.map(relation => {
    if (relation.relationshipStrength > 0.8) {
      // High confidence - auto-executable
      return createAutoSyncWorkItem(relation, prEvent);
    } else if (relation.relationshipStrength > 0.5) {
      // Medium confidence - requires confirmation
      return createConfirmationSyncWorkItem(relation, prEvent);
    } else {
      // Low confidence - suggestion only
      return createSuggestionWorkItem(relation, prEvent);
    }
  });
}
```

#### 4.2 Work Item Types for Session Sync

1. **Auto-Sync Work Items** (High confidence, low risk)
   - Automatically merge main into session branch
   - Execute without human intervention
   - Report results and any issues

2. **Confirmation Sync Work Items** (Medium confidence or risk)
   - Prepare merge analysis
   - Request human approval before execution
   - Provide conflict preview and resolution suggestions

3. **Advisory Work Items** (Low confidence or high risk)
   - Notify about potential relevance
   - Suggest manual review
   - Provide analysis for human decision-making

### 5. CLI Integration

#### 5.1 Work Item Management Commands

```bash
# List all work items (system and user)
minsky work list [--type user-task|system-action|ai-suggestion] [--status pending|completed|failed]

# Execute pending system actions
minsky work execute [--auto-only] [--confirm-all] [--dry-run]

# Analyze PR impact (manual trigger)
minsky work analyze-pr <pr-id-or-commit>

# Session sync management
minsky sessions sync-status              # Show sync status of all sessions
minsky sessions sync <session-id>        # Manual sync trigger
minsky sessions sync --all [--dry-run]   # Sync all sessions
```

#### 5.2 Session-Aware Commands

```bash
# Enhanced session listing with sync status
minsky sessions list --show-sync-status
# Output:
# - session-123: Feature Work [BEHIND main by 3 commits] ⚠️ 
# - session-456: Bug Fix [UP TO DATE] ✅
# - session-789: Refactor [CONFLICTS detected] ⚠️

# Session sync workflow
minsky sessions sync session-123 --preview     # Show what would change
minsky sessions sync session-123 --auto        # Auto-resolve if possible
minsky sessions sync session-123 --interactive # Guide through conflicts
```

### 6. Implementation Architecture

#### 6.1 Event Processing Pipeline

```typescript
class PRMergeOrchestrator {
  async processPRMerge(event: PRMergeEvent): Promise<WorkItem[]> {
    // 1. Analyze impact
    const activeSessions = await this.sessionService.getActiveSessions();
    const relationships = await this.aiAnalyzer.analyzeSessionImpact(event, activeSessions);
    
    // 2. Generate work items
    const workItems = await this.generateSyncWorkItems(event, relationships);
    
    // 3. Store and optionally execute
    await this.workItemService.storeWorkItems(workItems);
    await this.executeAutoWorkItems(workItems.filter(wi => wi.automation?.executable));
    
    return workItems;
  }
}
```

#### 6.2 Work Item Execution Engine

```typescript
class WorkItemExecutor {
  async executeWorkItem(workItem: WorkItem): Promise<ExecutionResult> {
    try {
      switch (workItem.type) {
        case "system-action":
          return await this.executeSystemAction(workItem);
        case "ai-suggestion":
          return await this.processAISuggestion(workItem);
        default:
          throw new Error(`Cannot execute work item of type ${workItem.type}`);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      return this.handleExecutionError(workItem, error);
    }
  }
  
  private async executeSystemAction(workItem: WorkItem): Promise<ExecutionResult> {
    // Handle different system actions (sync, analyze, notify, etc.)
    const action = workItem.context.action;
    return await this.actionHandlers[action.type](action, workItem);
  }
}
```
