# Add AI-powered task decomposition and analysis

## Problem Statement

To enhance the task hierarchy system and enable intelligent task decomposition, we need AI-powered commands that can analyze complex tasks and automatically create parent-child task hierarchies. This builds on the core parent-child relationship system to provide intelligent task breakdown with **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring capabilities** for safe and observable AI-driven task planning.

## Context

With the parent-child task hierarchy system in place, we can now leverage AI to:

1. **Intelligent task decomposition** - AI analyzes complex tasks and suggests breakdown into subtasks
2. **Automated test decomposition** - AI creates comprehensive test task hierarchies
3. **Task estimation and analysis** - AI provides sizing and complexity analysis
4. **Hierarchy optimization** - AI suggests improvements to existing task structures
5. **Monitorable task planning** - AI reasoning about task breakdown becomes observable and intervenable

This enhances the manual task hierarchy system with intelligent automation capabilities while maintaining **Chain-of-Thought monitorability** for safety and control.

## Dependencies

1. **Task #235**: Leverages the research and architectural analysis from Task #235 "Add metadata support to tasks (subtasks, priority, dependencies)" to understand task metadata systems and backend capabilities.
2. **Task Hierarchy System** - Requires the parent-child relationship system (Tasks #246 or #247)
3. **AI Backend Infrastructure** - Requires Task #160 (AI completion backend with multi-provider support)

**⚠️ CRITICAL SEQUENCING**: This task MUST NOT begin implementation until:

1. Task #235 has completed its architectural decision and provided implementation guidelines
2. The chosen task hierarchy implementation (Task #246 or #247) has been completed
3. Task #160 (AI backend) is available

The AI integration approach described below may need to be revised based on #235's architectural decisions regarding metadata storage and backend capabilities.

## Future Direction Considerations

### Tactical Subtask Generation with Chain-of-Thought Monitoring

**RESEARCH REQUIRED**: This AI-powered decomposition should be designed to support future extension to generate tactical subtasks/todos with **full Chain-of-Thought monitoring capabilities**:

**Monitorable Tactical Operations:**
- Tool calls (grep_search, read_file, edit_file, etc.) with reasoning traces
- Code generation steps with decision rationale
- Thinking/analysis steps exposed as observable chains
- Verification operations with explicit validation reasoning

**Chain-of-Thought Safety Integration:**
- **Real-time monitoring** of AI reasoning during task decomposition
- **Pattern detection** for problematic decomposition approaches
- **Intervention points** where human can redirect task planning
- **Reasoning transparency** - full visibility into AI decision-making process

**Key architectural questions to preserve in this implementation:**

- Should tactical subtasks be stored as full task entities or lightweight execution metadata?
- How to support human-in-the-loop intervention before tactical execution?
- How to enable tactical subgraph recomputation when strategic requirements change?
- How to balance storage efficiency with full task graph visibility?
- **NEW: How to ensure tactical reasoning chains remain monitorable and interpretable?**
- **NEW: What intervention patterns are needed for safe AI-driven task planning?**

**Design Constraint**: The AI decomposition system should be extensible to support:

- **Pre-execution inspection** - Full tactical plan visibility before any actions
- **Intervention checkpoints** - Human review/modification of tactical plans
- **Subgraph recomputation** - Regenerating tactical plans when strategic tasks change
- **Execution rollback** - Using ephemeral git branches for safe tactical experimentation
- **NEW: Chain-of-Thought monitoring** - Real-time observation of AI reasoning during decomposition
- **NEW: Reasoning pattern detection** - Automated detection of problematic planning approaches
- **NEW: Intervention mechanisms** - Ability to interrupt and redirect AI planning mid-stream

**Architecture Impact**: Consider how AI-generated tactical subtasks relate to strategic subtasks and user-specified tasks in the overall hierarchy, with **full Chain-of-Thought monitorability** throughout the decomposition process.

## Chain-of-Thought Monitoring Integration

### Monitoring AI Task Decomposition

**Real-time Reasoning Observation:**
- Monitor AI reasoning chains during task analysis and breakdown
- Detect when AI is making suboptimal decomposition decisions
- Identify opportunities for human guidance or intervention
- Track reasoning quality and consistency across decompositions

**Safety Through Transparency:**
- All AI reasoning about task breakdown is observable
- Intervention possible at any point in the decomposition process
- Human can redirect AI reasoning before inappropriate task structures are created
- Full audit trail of AI decision-making in task planning

**Intervention Patterns for Task Planning:**
- **Scope creep detection** - AI expanding beyond intended task boundaries
- **Over-decomposition** - AI creating unnecessarily complex hierarchies
- **Under-decomposition** - AI failing to break down complex tasks adequately
- **Inappropriate dependencies** - AI creating problematic task relationships

### Monitorability Requirements

**Transparent Reasoning:**
- AI must externalize reasoning about task complexity, dependencies, and breakdown strategies
- Decision rationale for each decomposition choice must be observable
- Alternative approaches considered must be visible
- Confidence levels and uncertainty acknowledgment required

**Intervention Capability:**
- System must support interrupting AI decomposition mid-process
- Human can provide corrective guidance at any reasoning step
- AI must be able to incorporate intervention feedback and restart reasoning
- Partial decomposition results must be preservable across interventions

## Proposed Solution

**NOTE**: The technical approach described below is provisional and subject to revision based on Task #235's architectural decisions and the implemented hierarchy system.

### Core AI Commands

1. **`minsky tasks decompose <task-id>`**

   - Analyzes task specification and suggests breakdown into subtasks
   - Creates parent-child hierarchy automatically with `--create` flag
   - Focuses on test decomposition patterns for development workflows

2. **`minsky tasks estimate <task-id>`**

   - Provides AI-powered task sizing and complexity estimation
   - Analyzes task hierarchy depth and suggests optimization
   - Estimates effort for task and all subtasks

3. **`minsky tasks analyze <task-id>`**
   - Provides comprehensive task analysis including completeness, clarity, and structure
   - Suggests improvements to task specifications
   - Identifies potential missing subtasks or test cases

### Enhanced AI Features

4. **`minsky tasks decompose-tests <task-id>`**
