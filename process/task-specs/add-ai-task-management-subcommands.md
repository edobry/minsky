# Add AI-powered task decomposition and analysis

## Problem Statement

To enhance the task hierarchy system and enable intelligent task decomposition, we need AI-powered commands that can analyze complex tasks and automatically create parent-child task hierarchies. This builds on the core parent-child relationship system to provide intelligent task breakdown.

## Context

With the parent-child task hierarchy system in place, we can now leverage AI to:

1. **Intelligent task decomposition** - AI analyzes complex tasks and suggests breakdown into subtasks
2. **Automated test decomposition** - AI creates comprehensive test task hierarchies
3. **Task estimation and analysis** - AI provides sizing and complexity analysis
4. **Hierarchy optimization** - AI suggests improvements to existing task structures

This enhances the manual task hierarchy system with intelligent automation capabilities.

## Dependencies

1. **Task #235**: Leverages the research and architectural analysis from Task #235 "Add metadata support to tasks (subtasks, priority, dependencies)" to understand task metadata systems and backend capabilities.
2. **Task Hierarchy System** - Requires the parent-child relationship system (Tasks #246 or #247)
3. **AI Backend Infrastructure** - Requires Task #160 (AI completion backend with multi-provider support)

**⚠️ CRITICAL SEQUENCING**: This task MUST NOT begin implementation until:

1. Task #235 has completed its architectural decision and provided implementation guidelines
2. The chosen task hierarchy implementation (Task #246 or #247) has been completed
3. Task #160 (AI backend) is available

The AI integration approach described below may need to be revised based on #235's architectural decisions regarding metadata storage and backend capabilities.

## Proposed Solution

**NOTE**: The technical approach described below is provisional and subject to revision based on Task #235's architectural decisions and the implemented hierarchy system.

### Core AI Commands

1. **`minsky tasks decompose <task-id>`**

   - Analyzes task specification and suggests breakdown into subtasks
   - Creates parent-child hierarchy automatically with `--create` flag
   - Focuses on test decomposition patterns for development workflows

2. **`minsky tasks estimate <task-id>`**

   - Provides AI-powered task sizing and complexity estimation
   - Analyzes task hierarchy depth and suggests optimization
   - Estimates effort for task and all subtasks

3. **`minsky tasks analyze <task-id>`**
   - Provides comprehensive task analysis including completeness, clarity, and structure
   - Suggests improvements to task specifications
   - Identifies potential missing subtasks or test cases

### Enhanced AI Features

4. **`minsky tasks decompose-tests <task-id>`**

   - Specialized command for test decomposition
   - Creates comprehensive test task hierarchies:
     - Unit tests → individual test cases
     - Integration tests → component interaction tests
     - E2E tests → user flow tests
   - Follows testing best practices and patterns

5. **`minsky tasks optimize-hierarchy <task-id>`**
   - Analyzes existing task hierarchy and suggests improvements
   - Identifies over-decomposition or under-decomposition
   - Suggests better organization of subtasks

## Technical Implementation

**⚠️ IMPLEMENTATION NOTICE**: All technical implementation details are provisional and must be aligned with:

- Task #235's architectural decisions (metadata storage, backend capabilities)
- The implemented hierarchy system from Task #246 or #247
- Task #160's AI backend architecture

### AI Integration (Building on Task #160)

1. **TaskDecompositionService** (provisional design):

   - Uses AI backend for task analysis
   - Specialized prompts for task breakdown
   - Integration with TaskHierarchyService (to be defined by hierarchy implementation)

2. **Prompt Templates** (subject to revision):

   - **Decomposition prompt**: Analyzes task and suggests subtasks
   - **Test decomposition prompt**: Creates comprehensive test hierarchies
   - **Estimation prompt**: Provides sizing and complexity analysis
   - **Analysis prompt**: Reviews task quality and completeness

3. **AI Response Processing** (subject to revision based on #235's decisions):
   - Structured AI responses for creating task hierarchies
   - Validation of suggested decomposition
   - User confirmation before creating multiple subtasks

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 0: Architectural and Dependency Alignment (REQUIRED FIRST)

1. **Wait for Task #235 completion** - Do not proceed until architectural decisions are made
2. **Wait for hierarchy system implementation** - Requires Task #246 or #247 completion
3. **Verify Task #160 availability** - Ensure AI backend is functional
4. **Review all architectural guidelines** - Align with #235's metadata architecture decisions
5. **Revise AI integration approach** - Update based on implemented hierarchy system and #235's architecture
6. **Get comprehensive approval** - Confirm AI approach works with chosen architecture and hierarchy implementation

### Phase 1: Core AI Commands (After all dependencies completed)

- Implementation details to be finalized based on dependency outcomes

## Use Cases

### AI-Powered Test Decomposition

```bash
# Create main feature task
minsky tasks create "Implement user authentication"

# Let AI decompose into test hierarchy
minsky tasks decompose-tests 123 --create

# Result: Complete test task hierarchy automatically created
minsky tasks tree 123
```

### Complex Feature Analysis

```bash
# Create complex task
minsky tasks create "Add real-time notifications"

# Get AI analysis and decomposition
minsky tasks decompose 200 --create

# Get effort estimation for entire hierarchy
minsky tasks estimate 200 --recursive
```

### Hierarchy Optimization

```bash
# Analyze existing complex hierarchy
minsky tasks optimize-hierarchy 150

# Get suggestions for improvement
minsky tasks analyze 150 --suggest-improvements
```
