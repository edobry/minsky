# Add AI-powered task decomposition and analysis

## Problem Statement

To enhance the task hierarchy system and enable intelligent task decomposition, we need AI-powered commands that can analyze complex tasks and automatically create parent-child task hierarchies. This builds on the core parent-child relationship system to provide intelligent task breakdown.

## Context

With the parent-child task hierarchy system in place, we can now leverage AI to:

1. **Intelligent task decomposition** - AI analyzes complex tasks and suggests breakdown into subtasks
2. **Automated test decomposition** - AI creates comprehensive test task hierarchies
3. **Task estimation and analysis** - AI provides sizing and complexity analysis
4. **Hierarchy optimization** - AI suggests improvements to existing task structures

This enhances the manual task hierarchy system with intelligent automation capabilities.

## Dependencies

1. **Task #235**: Leverages the research and architectural analysis from Task #235 "Add metadata support to tasks (subtasks, priority, dependencies)" to understand task metadata systems and backend capabilities.
2. **Task Hierarchy System** - Requires the parent-child relationship system (separate task spec)
3. **AI Backend Infrastructure** - Requires Task #160 (AI completion backend with multi-provider support)

## Proposed Solution

### Core AI Commands

1. **`minsky tasks decompose <task-id>`**

   - Analyzes task specification and suggests breakdown into subtasks
   - Creates parent-child hierarchy automatically with `--create` flag
   - Focuses on test decomposition patterns for development workflows

2. **`minsky tasks estimate <task-id>`**

   - Provides AI-powered task sizing and complexity estimation
   - Analyzes task hierarchy depth and suggests optimization
   - Estimates effort for task and all subtasks

3. **`minsky tasks analyze <task-id>`**
   - Provides comprehensive task analysis including completeness, clarity, and structure
   - Suggests improvements to task specifications
   - Identifies potential missing subtasks or test cases

### Enhanced AI Features

4. **`minsky tasks decompose-tests <task-id>`**

   - Specialized command for test decomposition
   - Creates comprehensive test task hierarchies:
     - Unit tests → individual test cases
     - Integration tests → component interaction tests
     - E2E tests → user flow tests
   - Follows testing best practices and patterns

5. **`minsky tasks optimize-hierarchy <task-id>`**
   - Analyzes existing task hierarchy and suggests improvements
   - Identifies over-decomposition or under-decomposition
   - Suggests better organization of subtasks

## Technical Implementation

### AI Integration (Building on Task #160)

1. **TaskDecompositionService**:

   - Uses AI backend for task analysis
   - Specialized prompts for task breakdown
   - Integration with TaskHierarchyService for creating relationships

2. **Prompt Templates**:

   - **Decomposition prompt**: Analyzes task and suggests subtasks
   - **Test decomposition prompt**: Creates comprehensive test hierarchies
   - **Estimation prompt**: Provides sizing and complexity analysis
   - **Analysis prompt**: Reviews task quality and completeness

3. **AI Response Processing**:
   - Structured AI responses for creating task hierarchies
   - Validation of suggested decomposition
   - User confirmation before creating multiple subtasks

### Command Implementation

1. **`minsky tasks decompose <task-id>`**:

   ```bash
   # Analyze and suggest decomposition
   minsky tasks decompose 123

   # Automatically create suggested subtasks
   minsky tasks decompose 123 --create

   # Focus on test decomposition
   minsky tasks decompose 123 --type tests
   ```

2. **Response Format**:

   ```
   AI Analysis for Task #123: "Implement user authentication"

   Suggested Decomposition:
   ├── Unit Tests (estimated: 2-3 days)
   │   ├── Test login validation
   │   ├── Test password hashing
   │   └── Test session management
   ├── Integration Tests (estimated: 1-2 days)
   │   ├── Test API endpoints
   │   └── Test database integration
   └── E2E Tests (estimated: 1 day)
       └── Test complete user flow

   Total estimated effort: 4-6 days

   Create this hierarchy? (y/n)
   ```

## Use Cases

### AI-Powered Test Decomposition

```bash
# Create main feature task
minsky tasks create "Implement user authentication"

# Let AI decompose into test hierarchy
minsky tasks decompose-tests 123 --create

# Result: Complete test task hierarchy automatically created
minsky tasks tree 123
```

### Complex Feature Analysis

```bash
# Create complex task
minsky tasks create "Add real-time notifications"

# Get AI analysis and decomposition
minsky tasks decompose 200 --create

# Get effort estimation for entire hierarchy
minsky tasks estimate 200 --recursive
```

### Hierarchy Optimization

```bash
# Analyze existing complex hierarchy
minsky tasks optimize-hierarchy 150

# Get suggestions for improvement
minsky tasks analyze 150 --suggest-improvements
```
