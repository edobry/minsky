# Add AI-powered task decomposition and analysis (GitHub Issues Approach)

## Problem Statement

To enhance the task hierarchy system and enable intelligent task decomposition, we need AI-powered commands that can analyze complex tasks and automatically create parent-child task hierarchies using **GitHub Issues as the task backend**. This builds on GitHub's native relationship capabilities to provide intelligent task breakdown with **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring capabilities** for safe and observable AI-driven task planning.

## Strategic Context: GitHub Issues Interim Approach

**ARCHITECTURAL DECISION**: Following the completion of Task #325 (Task Backend Architecture Analysis), we are implementing a **GitHub Issues interim strategy** that:

1. **Uses GitHub Issues** as the primary task backend for immediate value
2. **Defers complex backend decisions** until implementing AI features that require advanced capabilities
3. **Leverages GitHub's native capabilities** (labels, milestones, references) for task relationships
4. **Provides clear migration path** to specialized backends when needed

This approach allows us to implement AI features immediately while preserving future flexibility.

## Context

With GitHub Issues as our task backend, we can now leverage AI to:

1. **Intelligent task decomposition** - AI analyzes GitHub Issues and suggests breakdown into subtasks
2. **Automated test decomposition** - AI creates comprehensive test task hierarchies as GitHub Issues
3. **Task estimation and analysis** - AI provides sizing and complexity analysis using GitHub Issue content
4. **Hierarchy optimization** - AI suggests improvements to existing GitHub Issue relationships
5. **Monitorable task planning** - AI reasoning about task breakdown becomes observable and intervenable

This enhances GitHub's native issue management with intelligent automation capabilities while maintaining **Chain-of-Thought monitorability** for safety and control.

## Dependencies

1. **GitHub Issues Backend**: Requires implementation of GitHub Issues as primary task backend
2. **AI Backend Infrastructure**: Requires Task #160 (AI completion backend with multi-provider support)

**⚠️ UPDATED DEPENDENCY STRATEGY**:

- **REMOVED**: ~~Task #235 (metadata research)~~ - Deferred to future advanced backend implementation
- **REMOVED**: ~~Task hierarchy implementation (Tasks #246 or #247)~~ - Using GitHub Issues native capabilities instead
- **SIMPLIFIED**: Focus on GitHub API integration and AI processing of GitHub Issue content

## Future Direction Considerations

### Tactical Subtask Generation with Chain-of-Thought Monitoring

**RESEARCH REQUIRED**: This AI-powered decomposition should be designed to support future extension to generate tactical subtasks/todos with **full Chain-of-Thought monitoring capabilities**:

**Monitorable Tactical Operations:**

- Tool calls (grep_search, read_file, edit_file, etc.) with reasoning traces
- Code generation steps with decision rationale
- Thinking/analysis steps exposed as observable chains
- Verification operations with explicit validation reasoning

**Chain-of-Thought Safety Integration:**

- **Real-time monitoring** of AI reasoning during task decomposition
- **Pattern detection** for problematic decomposition approaches
- **Intervention points** where human can redirect task planning
- **Reasoning transparency** - full visibility into AI decision-making process

**Key architectural questions to preserve in this implementation:**

- Should tactical subtasks be stored as full task entities or lightweight execution metadata?
- How to support human-in-the-loop intervention before tactical execution?
- How to enable tactical subgraph recomputation when strategic requirements change?
- How to balance storage efficiency with full task graph visibility?
- **NEW: How to ensure tactical reasoning chains remain monitorable and interpretable?**
- **NEW: What intervention patterns are needed for safe AI-driven task planning?**

**Design Constraint**: The AI decomposition system should be extensible to support:

- **Pre-execution inspection** - Full tactical plan visibility before any actions
- **Intervention checkpoints** - Human review/modification of tactical plans
- **Subgraph recomputation** - Regenerating tactical plans when strategic tasks change
- **Execution rollback** - Using ephemeral git branches for safe tactical experimentation
- **NEW: Chain-of-Thought monitoring** - Real-time observation of AI reasoning during decomposition
- **NEW: Reasoning pattern detection** - Automated detection of problematic planning approaches
- **NEW: Intervention mechanisms** - Ability to interrupt and redirect AI planning mid-stream

**Architecture Impact**: Consider how AI-generated tactical subtasks relate to strategic subtasks and user-specified tasks in the overall hierarchy, with **full Chain-of-Thought monitorability** throughout the decomposition process.

## Chain-of-Thought Monitoring Integration

### Monitoring AI Task Decomposition

**Real-time Reasoning Observation:**

- Monitor AI reasoning chains during task analysis and breakdown
- Detect when AI is making suboptimal decomposition decisions
- Identify opportunities for human guidance or intervention
- Track reasoning quality and consistency across decompositions

**Safety Through Transparency:**

- All AI reasoning about task breakdown is observable
- Intervention possible at any point in the decomposition process
- Human can redirect AI reasoning before inappropriate task structures are created
- Full audit trail of AI decision-making in task planning

**Intervention Patterns for Task Planning:**

- **Scope creep detection** - AI expanding beyond intended task boundaries
- **Over-decomposition** - AI creating unnecessarily complex hierarchies
- **Under-decomposition** - AI failing to break down complex tasks adequately
- **Inappropriate dependencies** - AI creating problematic task relationships

### Monitorability Requirements

**Transparent Reasoning:**

- AI must externalize reasoning about task complexity, dependencies, and breakdown strategies
- Decision rationale for each decomposition choice must be observable
- Alternative approaches considered must be visible
- Confidence levels and uncertainty acknowledgment required

**Intervention Capability:**

- System must support interrupting AI decomposition mid-process
- Human can provide corrective guidance at any reasoning step
- AI must be able to incorporate intervention feedback and restart reasoning
- Partial decomposition results must be preservable across interventions

   }
   ```

2. **GitHub Issues Relationship Management**:

   ```typescript
   // Use GitHub's native capabilities for relationships
   interface GitHubTaskRelationships {
     // Parent-child via issue references and labels
     parentTask?: number; // Referenced in issue body
     childTasks: number[]; // Found via label queries

     // Dependencies via issue references
     blockedBy: number[]; // "Blocked by #123"
     blocks: number[]; // "Blocks #456"

     // Related tasks via labels and references
     relatedTasks: number[]; // Cross-referenced issues
   }
   ```
