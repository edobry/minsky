# Process Documentation

This directory contains technical process documents and implementation plans for significant refactoring and architectural changes to the codebase.

## Purpose

- Document major design decisions and architectural changes
- Provide detailed implementation plans for complex features
- Serve as reference for engineers implementing changes
- Create a history of technical evolution for the project

## How to Use These Documents

1. **For Implementers**: Use these documents as a step-by-step guide when implementing the described changes. Each document should provide enough detail to understand:

   - What needs to be changed
   - Why the change is necessary
   - How to implement the change in a structured way
   - What the expected outcomes are

2. **For Reviewers**: Use these documents to understand the motivation behind significant code changes and to evaluate if the implementation matches the intended design.

3. **For New Contributors**: Read these documents to understand the design decisions and architectural patterns used in the project.

## Document Format

Each process document typically includes:

- **Overview**: A high-level summary of the proposed changes
- **Current Issues**: Description of the problems being addressed
- **Goals**: What the changes aim to achieve
- **Implementation Plan**: Detailed steps to complete the changes
- **Benefits**: Expected improvements from implementing the changes
- **Examples**: Sample code or usage examples where appropriate

## Adding New Process Documents

When planning a significant code change:

1. Create a new markdown file with a descriptive name (e.g., `command-refactoring.md`)
2. Follow the standard format for process documents
3. Include enough detail for a junior engineer to implement the changes
4. Reference relevant parts of the codebase
