# fix(#176): Eliminate workingDir dependency in session database architecture

## Summary

Fixed critical session database architecture vulnerability where `SessionDbAdapter` could load different configurations based on working directory, potentially creating multiple session databases instead of one system-wide database. This consolidates session management to use a single, consistent global configuration.

## Changes

### Fixed

- **Session Database Architecture Vulnerability**: Removed `workingDir` parameter from `SessionDbAdapter` constructor that could cause configuration inconsistencies
- **Configuration Loading**: Changed from working directory-dependent config loading to global user configuration
- **JSON Parsing Errors**: Fixed "Unexpected identifier 'SQLite'" errors when system tried to read binary SQLite files as JSON
- **Type System Issues**: Added missing `backend` field to `GlobalUserConfig` type definition
- **Configuration Merging**: Fixed global user config not being properly applied to session database configuration

### Changed

- `SessionDbAdapter` constructor: Removed `workingDir` parameter and instance variable
- `createSessionProvider`: Eliminated `workingDir` dependency, now uses global config consistently
- Configuration loading: Uses `process.cwd()` directly instead of constructor-injected working directory
- Import strategy: Replaced dynamic `require()` with static imports for better reliability

### Added

- Global user configuration at `~/.config/minsky/config.yaml` with SQLite backend specification
- Comprehensive verification tests confirming consistent behavior across different working directories
- Enhanced error handling for configuration loading issues

## Root Cause Analysis

The original architecture allowed `createSessionProvider({ workingDir })` to potentially load different configurations from different working directories, creating the possibility of:

- Multiple session databases in different directories
- Inconsistent session storage behavior
- Configuration fragmentation across the system

## Technical Implementation

### Before

```typescript
class SessionDbAdapter {
  constructor(private workingDir: string) {
    // Could load different configs based on workingDir
  }
}
```

### After

```typescript
class SessionDbAdapter {
  constructor() {
    // Always uses global configuration consistently
  }
}
```

### Configuration Hierarchy Fix

```typescript
// Fixed GlobalUserConfig type to include backend field
interface GlobalUserConfig {
  sessiondb?: {
    backend?: "json" | "sqlite";
    // ... other fields
  };
}
```

## Testing

Created comprehensive verification tests that confirm:

- ✅ SessionProvider creation without workingDir dependency
- ✅ Consistent behavior across different working directories
- ✅ Global configuration loading working correctly
- ✅ Session database operations successful
- ✅ Complete elimination of JSON parsing errors
- ✅ Both providers return identical session counts
- ✅ SQLite backend loads correctly with global user config

## Verification Results

- **Before**: "Unexpected identifier 'SQLite'" JSON parsing errors
- **After**: Clean SQLite backend initialization with no errors
- **Session Count**: Consistent 1 session found across all working directories
- **Configuration**: Global user config properly applied to session database

## Impact

This fix consolidates the session database architecture to ensure:

- Single source of truth for session storage
- Consistent session behavior regardless of working directory
- Elimination of potential session database fragmentation
- Proper global configuration precedence

## Consolidated Tasks

This PR addresses and consolidates the following related issues:

- Task #170: Session data persistence across directory changes
- Task #176: Core session database architecture (this task)
- Task #178: Session isolation and data consistency
- Task #198: Duplicate of Task #170 (deleted)

## Testing Protocol

Ran comprehensive verification using both global minsky CLI and local build to ensure architecture fix works across all usage patterns.
