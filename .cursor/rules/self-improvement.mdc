# Self-Improvement Rules

## Avoid Spurious Echo Commands

### Rule: Minimize Unnecessary Echo Output

**STOP using excessive echo commands for "pretty" terminal formatting.**

### Prohibited Patterns:
- ❌ `echo "=== SECTION HEADERS ==="`
- ❌ `echo "Doing X..." && actual_command && echo "Done"`  
- ❌ Multiple echo commands for formatting/spacing
- ❌ Echo commands that just repeat what the actual command will show
- ❌ Verbose progress narration via echo

### Allowed Echo Usage:
- ✅ Essential status information not provided by the command
- ✅ Single concise confirmation of completion
- ✅ Critical error/warning messages
- ✅ When command output needs parsing/filtering

### Examples:

**❌ BAD - Excessive formatting:**
```bash
echo "=== CLEANING UP TEST TASKS ===" 
echo "Current test tasks:" 
ls -la process/tasks/md#38[23]*
echo -e "\nRemoving test task files..."
rm process/tasks/md#382-*.md process/tasks/md#383-*.md
echo "Removed test task files"
```

**✅ GOOD - Direct and minimal:**
```bash
ls -la process/tasks/md#38[23]*
rm process/tasks/md#382-*.md process/tasks/md#383-*.md
```

### Core Principle:
**Let commands speak for themselves. Users can see what's happening from the actual command output.**

Terminal output should be functional, not decorative. Focus on doing the work, not narrating it.
