# Self-Improvement

When the user indicates that your actions, reasoning, or responses are incorrect or suboptimal, or when they express preferences for future behavior, implement this systematic error detection and correction framework.

## Error Detection Signals

### User Dissatisfaction Signals
- Direct correction: "that's wrong", "incorrect", "not right"
- Questions about rationale: "why did you do that?", "what were you thinking?"
- Expressions of frustration: "you're doing [problem] again", "you keep making this mistake"
- Implied dissatisfaction: "that's not what I asked for", "this doesn't work"
- Preference directives: "make sure to always...", "going forward, always..."

## Self-Reflection Protocol

**When triggered, follow this exact procedure:**

1. **Stop Current Task** - Immediately pause and acknowledge feedback
2. **Root Cause Analysis** - Identify specific failure cause and error category:
   ```
   [ ] Assumption Error: Started with incorrect premise
   [ ] Process Error: Used wrong methodology/approach
   [ ] Instruction Error: Misunderstood or skipped requirements
   [ ] Context Error: Failed to consider relevant information
   [ ] Pattern Error: Applied pattern inappropriately
   [ ] Verification Error: Failed to validate before proceeding
   [ ] Tool Error: Misused available tools/functions
   [ ] Preference Error: Failed to adhere to user preferences
   [ ] Completion Assessment Error: Declared completion without proper verification
   ```
3. **Verbalize Understanding** - Confirm comprehension of user's concern
4. **Apply Correction** - Make immediate changes using tools, not plans
5. **Verify Alignment** - Confirm approach meets user needs before resuming

## Rule Update Authority Hierarchy

When updating rules based on feedback:
1. **Project Workflow/Process Rules**: Update first for process/workflow requirements
2. **User-Preferences Rule**: Update for personal preferences not covered by workflow rules
3. **Self-Improvement Rule**: Update for meta-process corrections and error analysis
4. **Domain-Specific Rules**: Update only for domain-specific issues

**CRITICAL**: After identifying required rule changes, they MUST be implemented immediately using edit tools, not merely described.

## ⚠️ Systematic Verification Failure Protocol

**Addresses repeated failures to apply existing verification rules**

### When User Reports Repeated Rule Violations:

1. **Immediate Verification Audit**:
   - Execute all mandatory verification checks from relevant loaded rules
   - Do not submit responses without completing required scans
   - Rewrite completely if violations found

2. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Process Gap: Not executing mandatory steps from existing rules
   - Attention Failure: Rushing without applying required checks
   - Rule Application Failure: Having correct rules but ignoring them

3. **Enforcement Mechanism**:
   - If user reports SAME violation twice: Treat as critical protocol failure
   - Immediately audit complete verification process
   - Update enforcement mechanisms to prevent recurrence

### Mandatory Response Verification
**EVERY response must pass this check:**
1. **Rule Compliance**: Execute all mandatory protocols from relevant loaded rules
2. **Response Quality**: Answer actual question, implement rather than describe
3. **Verification Complete**: Confirm all required checks performed

## When to Apply This Rule

This rule MUST be applied whenever:
1. The user expresses dissatisfaction
2. The user corrects you
3. The user indicates confusion
4. The user expresses a preference for future behavior
5. The user asks you to do something differently
6. Your action results in an error
