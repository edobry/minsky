# Minsky Session Management Protocol

**NO IMPLEMENTATION WORK CAN BEGIN WITHOUT AN ACTIVE SESSION**

This rule defines the procedures for creating, navigating, and managing Minsky sessions, which provide isolated workspaces for task implementation.

## What is a Minsky Session?

A Minsky session is an isolated workspace for implementing a specific task. It ensures:

1. **Isolation**: Changes are isolated from the main workspace until they're ready for review
2. **Traceability**: Each session is associated with a specific task
3. **Reproducibility**: Sessions can be recreated or updated as needed
