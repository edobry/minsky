# Enhanced Implementation Verification Protocol

## MANDATORY TRIGGER SYSTEM

**This rule AUTOMATICALLY ACTIVATES when using completion language:**
- "successfully", "completed", "working", "verified", "implemented", "finished", "done"

## FORCED VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

**BEFORE using ANY completion language, MUST:**

1. **STOP** - Identify what success means quantifiably
2. **VERIFY** - Run the actual verification command  
3. **SHOW** - Display the numeric result
4. **EVALUATE** - Only proceed if result shows success criteria met

## MANDATORY VERIFICATION COMMANDS

**For ESLint rule tasks:**
```bash
# MUST show 0 for completion
bun lint 2>&1 | grep "[rule-name]" | wc -l
```

**For pattern migration tasks:**
```bash
# MUST show 0 for completion  
grep -r "[pattern]" --include="*.ts" src/ | wc -l
```

**For test functionality:**
```bash
# MUST show passing tests
bun test [relevant-test-files]
```

## ENFORCEMENT LANGUAGE

**❌ FORBIDDEN without verification:**
- "Successfully [anything]"
- "Working correctly" 
- "Completed"
- "Verified working"

**✅ REQUIRED if metrics show incomplete:**
- "Partial progress: X→Y remaining"
- "In progress: N issues left"
- "Code written, needs verification"

**✅ ONLY after showing 0/success metrics:**
- "Verified complete: [command output showing 0]"
- "Confirmed working: [test output]"

## SYSTEMATIC PREVENTION

**This rule creates a FORCING FUNCTION:**
1. Completion language triggers mandatory verification
2. Must show actual command output
3. Must demonstrate success criteria met
4. Cannot proceed without proof
