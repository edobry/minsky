# Task Implementation Workflow

This rule provides a detailed, step-by-step process for implementing tasks in the Minsky workflow.

## Task Implementation Lifecycle

### 1. Task Selection

1. **List available tasks**:
   ```bash
   minsky tasks list --json
   ```

2. **View task details**:
   ```bash
   minsky tasks get <task-id>
   ```

   You can also view the full task specification content:
   ```bash
   minsky tasks spec <task-id>
   ```

3. **Check the current status**:
   ```bash
   minsky tasks status get <task-id>
   ```

### 2. Session Setup

1. **Start a new session for the task**:
   ```bash
   minsky session start --task <task-id>
   ```
   This will automatically set the task status to IN-PROGRESS.

2. **Enter the session directory**:
   ```bash
   cd $(minsky session dir --task <task-id>)
   ```

3. **Verify session setup**:
   ```bash
   minsky session get --task <task-id>
   git status
   ```

### 3. Implementation Planning

1. **Read the task specification**:
   - Use the Minsky CLI to view the task specification:
     ```bash
     minsky tasks spec <task-id>
     ```
   - Alternatively, locate the task spec file at `process/tasks/<task-id>-<task-name>.md`
   - Review all requirements and acceptance criteria

2. **Plan your implementation**:
   - Identify the files you need to modify
   - Sketch out the changes you'll make
   - Identify any dependencies or potential issues

3. **Document your plan**:
   - Add your implementation plan to the task specification file
   - Commit this update:
     ```bash
     git add process/tasks/<task-id>-<task-name>.md
     git commit -m "Add implementation plan for task #<task-id>"
     ```

### 4. Development Phase

1. **Rule Verification (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)**:
   - **BEFORE writing any code**, identify and consult ALL relevant rules:
     - Import/dependency rules (e.g., no-dynamic-imports, bun_over_node)
     - Architecture rules (e.g., domain-oriented-modules, architectural-bypass-prevention)
     - Code quality rules (e.g., template-literals, constants-management)
     - Testing rules (e.g., testing-router, bun-test-patterns)
   - Search for rules related to the implementation approach using semantic search
   - Explicitly state which rules apply and how they will guide implementation
   - Document rule compliance plan in the task specification

2. **Make code changes**:
   - Modify the required files following identified rules
   - Follow project coding standards
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Ensure backward compatibility

3. **Commit changes regularly**:
   - Use meaningful commit messages with task ID references
   - Group related changes in logical commits
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "task #<task-id>: Add new function for handling X"
     ```

4. **Verify changes**:
   - Run tests to ensure nothing is broken
   - Check for linting errors and code quality issues
   - Verify that all task requirements are met
   - **Verify rule compliance**: Confirm implementation follows all identified rules

### 4a. Implementation Verification Protocol

1. **Extract Requirements Checklist**:
   - At the beginning of implementation, extract all deliverables from the task description
   - Create a clear, itemized checklist in the task document under a "Requirements Checklist" section
   - Format each item to be easily verifiable (specific and concrete)

2. **Track Implementation Progress**:
   - Mark requirements as "In Progress" when work begins
   - Only mark as "Complete" when fully implemented, tested, and documented
   - Include implementation details with each completed item

3. **Systematic Verification**:
   - Before proceeding beyond implementation phase, perform a line-by-line comparison:
     - Original task requirements vs. actual implementation
     - Check each function, interface, and component mentioned in requirements
     - Verify modified files against the requirements list

4. **Verification Documentation**:
   - Document the verification process in the task document
   - List any gaps or partial implementations explicitly
   - Record verification timestamp and outcome

5. **Implementation Completeness Sign-off**:
   - Add a formal "Implementation Completeness" section to the task document
   - Explicitly state: "All requirements have been fully implemented and verified"
   - Only proceed to Final Verification after this sign-off

### 5. Final Verification

1. **Run all tests**:
   ```bash
   bun test
   ```

2. **Update task documentation**:
   - Add implementation details to the task spec
   - Document any design decisions or trade-offs
   - Update the implementation plan with actual changes made

3. **Prepare PR description**:
   ```bash
   minsky git pr --task <task-id>
   ```
   Save the output to `process/tasks/<task-id>/pr.md`

### 6. Task Completion

1. **Update CHANGELOG.md**:
   - Add entries for all changes made
   - Reference the task ID in changelog entries

2. **Commit final changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete implementation of task #<task-id>"
   ```

3. **Push changes**:
   ```bash
   git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
   ```

4. **Update task status**:
   ```bash
   minsky tasks status set <task-id> IN-REVIEW
   ```
   This can also happen automatically when using `minsky git pr`.

## Work Log Guidelines

Maintain a "Work Log" section in the task document to track implementation progress:

```markdown
## Work Log
- YYYY-MM-DD: Implemented X feature
- YYYY-MM-DD: Fixed Y bug
- YYYY-MM-DD: Added tests for Z functionality
```

This log will be used to update the changelog when the task is complete.

## Task Completion Checklist

Task implementation is not complete until ALL these steps are performed:

1. ✓ All code changes are made in the session directory (not main workspace)
2. ✓ All tests pass in the session directory
3. ✓ All task requirements are systematically verified as complete
4. ✓ Task document contains Requirements Checklist with all items marked complete
5. ✓ Task document includes Implementation Completeness sign-off
6. ✓ Task document is updated with Work Log and verification steps
7. ✓ All changes are committed with task ID in commit message
8. ✓ Changes are pushed to remote
9. ✓ Changelog is updated appropriately
10. ✓ PR description is prepared
11. ✓ Task status is updated to IN-REVIEW
