# PR Preparation Workflow

This rule provides guidelines for preparing, reviewing, and merging pull requests (PRs) in the Minsky workflow.

## Core Principles

- Always verify implementation completeness before creating a PR
- Generate PR descriptions using the Minsky CLI
- Keep PR descriptions clear, comprehensive, and well-structured
- Follow the approval and merging process using the git approve command
- Update task status appropriately throughout the PR lifecycle

## PR Approval and Merging

### 2. Merging the PR

Once approved, use the Minsky CLI to merge the PR branch:

```bash
# With task ID
minsky git approve <pr-branch> --taskId <task-id>

# In a session
minsky git approve <pr-branch>
```

This will:
- Merge the PR branch into the base branch
- Store the merge commit hash and date in the task metadata
- Update the task status to reflect the merge
