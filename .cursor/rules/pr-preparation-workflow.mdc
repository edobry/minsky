# PR Preparation Workflow

This rule provides guidelines for preparing and submitting pull requests (PRs) in the Minsky workflow.

## PR Creation Process

### 1. Verify Implementation Completeness

Before creating a PR, ensure:

1. **All requirements are implemented**: Check the task specification to confirm all requirements are met
2. **All tests pass**: Run the test suite to ensure all tests pass
3. **Code quality is acceptable**: Check for any linting issues or code smells
4. **Documentation is updated**: Ensure task documentation and changelog are updated
