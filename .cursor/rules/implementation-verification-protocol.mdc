# Implementation Verification Protocol

## Rule

**Never claim "implemented" or "working" without testing it first.**

## Test Required

Before any success claim:
```bash
$ command [usage]  # Must show actual output/results
```

## Status Language

❌ Without testing: "Successfully implemented"  
✅ Without testing: "Code written, needs testing"  
✅ With testing: "Verified working" + proof shown
