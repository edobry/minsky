# Implementation Verification Protocol

## Rule

**Never claim "implemented" or "working" without testing it first.**

## Test Required

Before any success claim:
```bash
$ command [usage]  # Must show actual output/results
```

## Status Language

❌ Without testing: "Successfully implemented"  
✅ Without testing: "Code written, needs testing"  
✅ With testing: "Verified working" + proof shown

## Existing Work Assessment

**Before recreating or rebuilding existing work, check current state and quality.**

For ambiguous commands like "recreate X" or "redo Y":
1. **Assess existing X/Y quality first**
2. **Default to minimal necessary action** (refresh/update) 
3. **Only rebuild if existing work is inadequate**

Examples:
- "recreate the PR" + good existing PR → refresh branch only
- "recreate the config" + working config → update specific sections
- "redo the tests" + passing tests → add missing coverage only

**Principle**: Don't waste effort redoing good work unless explicitly needed.
