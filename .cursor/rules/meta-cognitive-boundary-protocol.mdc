# Meta-Cognitive Boundary Protocol

## Core Issue Identification

**CRITICAL VIOLATION**: Internal reasoning language leaking into external program artifacts.

**Example of Violation**: Function named `createRobustTempDir` where "robust" is internal assessment language about the assistant's problem-solving approach, not meaningful program functionality.

## The Meta-Cognitive Boundary

### Internal Reasoning Layer (Assistant's Mind)
- Assessment terms: "robust", "enhanced", "smart", "intelligent", "advanced"
- Problem-solving descriptors: "comprehensive", "thorough", "systematic"
- Internal process language: "fallback", "retry", "recovery"

### External Program Layer (User's Code)
- Functional descriptors: what the code actually does
- Domain-specific terminology: business logic concepts
- User-facing language: clear, direct, purposeful

## Prohibited Boundary Violations

❌ **NEVER use internal assessment terms in external code names:**
- `createRobustTempDir` → `createTempDirWithFallbacks`
- `enhancedErrorHandler` → `errorHandlerWithRetry`
- `smartConfigLoader` → `configLoaderWithDefaults`
- `comprehensiveValidator` → `validatorWithMultipleChecks`

## Required Boundary Maintenance

### Before naming ANY code artifact, ask:
1. **Is this internal reasoning language?** (robust, enhanced, smart, etc.)
2. **What does this code actually DO for the user?**
3. **Would a user understand this name without knowing my internal process?**

### Enforcement Protocol
- **STOP** immediately when using assessment terms in code names
- **TRANSLATE** internal reasoning to external functionality
- **VERIFY** the name describes user-facing behavior, not internal assessment

## Examples of Correct Translation

| Internal Assessment | External Functionality |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| "robust temp dir creation" | "temp dir creation with fallbacks" |
| "enhanced error handling" | "error handling with retry" |
| "smart configuration" | "configuration with defaults" |
| "comprehensive validation" | "multi-step validation" |

## Critical Enforcement

This rule addresses a **meta-cognitive boundary violation** where internal problem-solving language contaminates external program interfaces. This is not about style preferences but about maintaining clear separation between:

1. **What the assistant thinks about the code** (internal reasoning)
2. **What the code does for users** (external functionality)

**VIOLATION CONSEQUENCE**: Any use of internal assessment terms in code names indicates a fundamental boundary violation requiring immediate correction and rule application.

## Systematic Prevention

- **Pre-naming check**: Is this term from my internal reasoning vocabulary?
- **Functionality focus**: What does this code actually accomplish?
- **User perspective**: Would this name make sense to someone who doesn't know my internal process?

**This rule prevents "breaking the 4th wall" between internal reasoning and external program design.**
