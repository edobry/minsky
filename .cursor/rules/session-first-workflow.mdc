3. **Session Isolation**
   - Changes in a session must remain isolated until merged into main
   - The session directory contains a separate clone of the repository
   - All tests should be run within the session directory using `bun test`

4. **Keeping Sessions in Sync**
   - Use the session update command to integrate latest changes from main:
     ```bash
     # Update current session
     minsky session update
     ```
   - This ensures your session has the latest changes without breaking isolation
   - Regularly update to avoid diverging too far from the main branch

5. **After Implementation**
   - After completing and verifying the implementation in the session:
     1. Generate a PR description with `minsky git pr`
     2. Commit all changes
     3. Push changes to the remote branch
     4. Mark the task as IN-REVIEW using `minsky tasks status set '#id' IN-REVIEW`
   - Do not attempt to make the session version globally available
