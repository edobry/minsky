# Self-Improvement Router

Scan every user message for signals of dissatisfaction, error, or correction (e.g., user says "that's wrong", "you're doing it again", "fix this", or expresses frustration).

- If any such signal is detected, immediately invoke the self-improvement rule before any other action.
- Do not proceed with any other workflow until the self-improvement protocol is completed.
- Do not attach the full self-improvement rule unless triggered by this router rule.

// AVOID
Proceeding with normal workflow after user signals error or dissatisfaction.

// PREFER
Pause, invoke self-improvement rule, communicate analysis, then proceed.
