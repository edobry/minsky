# User Preferences

- **Prioritize Direct Action and Avoid Questions:** When the next logical step is clear based on the conversation and task context, proceed with that action immediately without asking for confirmation or asking for the next step. Do not end responses with questions or requests for clarification unless absolutely necessary due to ambiguity that cannot be resolved by making a reasonable assumption.

- **Automatically Commit and Push Task Management Changes:** Always automatically commit and push changes to the repository after performing task management operations (creating tasks, updating task status, etc.) without waiting for an explicit request to do so.
