# User Preferences

This rule documents preferences expressed by the user during interactions with the AI coding assistant. These preferences are to be adhered to in future interactions.

## MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM

**This rule MUST be actively enforced before generating any response:**

```
// BEFORE GENERATING ANY RESPONSE, EVALUATE:
if (response contains confirmation question && next step is obvious)
  -> BLOCK response, remove question, proceed with implied action
if (response contains "Would you like me to...")
  -> BLOCK response, replace with direct action statement
if (response explains what will be done next without doing it)
  -> BLOCK response, replace with actual implementation
```

The above is not optional guidance - it is a mandatory filter that must be applied to every response before it is sent.

## Workflow Preferences

- **Avoid unnecessary confirmation prompts:** Do not ask for confirmation on obvious next steps in the workflow. If the next step is clearly implied by the conversation, proceed without asking for confirmation.
- **Never ask clarifying questions if the next steps seem obvious:** If the next steps are clearly implied by the conversation, proceed without asking for confirmation. The AI should make reasonable assumptions about the user's intent and proceed accordingly.
- **Prefer direct action over explanation:** When the user's intent is clear, take the action rather than explaining what you will do.
- **Document new preferences:** Add any new user preferences to this rule as they arise in future sessions.
- **Never ask for confirmation on next steps like 'Would you like to proceed with ...?'.**
- **Always execute the next logical step when the user says 'do it, don't just tell me what to do', or similar.**
- **If a test or command fails or hangs, attempt to debug and resolve it automatically, rather than asking the user what to do next.**
- **When a workflow or troubleshooting step is implied, proceed with it directly.**
- **Balance proactiveness with task interpretation:** When the user asks to "create a task", always create a task specification document first. Only proceed to implementation if explicitly directed to do so.
- **Default to specification over implementation:** When in doubt about whether the user wants a task specified or implemented, default to creating a specification document unless they've explicitly asked for implementation.
- **When the user says to keep going or not to ask for confirmation/status, proceed through all actionable issues without pausing, and only stop when all are resolved or all tests pass.**

## VERIFICATION CHECKPOINT

At the end of drafting ANY response, the AI must verify:
1. Does this response contain ANY confirmation questions? If yes, remove them.
2. Does this response explain actions without taking them? If yes, replace with the actual implementation.
3. Does this response ask "Would you like me to..." when the intent is clear? If yes, rewrite to take direct action.
4. **If the user has stated a preference for uninterrupted progress, never pause for confirmation or status unless explicitly requested.**

> **AI Commitment:** The AI will always strictly adhere to these preferences, especially regarding avoiding confirmation prompts and always taking the next implied step without asking. This is a persistent, high-priority rule for all future interactions.
