# Testing Session Repository Changes

## Key Insight

When working in a session repository, be aware that executing the `minsky` command uses the globally installed version from the main workspace, not the version from your session repository with your in-progress changes.

## Correct Testing Method

To test code changes made in a session repository:

1. **Use `bun run` directly for local execution**:
   ```bash
   # WRONG - This runs the globally installed version, not your modified code
   minsky tasks list
   
   # CORRECT - This runs your modified code directly
   bun run ./src/cli.ts tasks list
   ```

2. **Create test scripts for targeted testing**:
   ```typescript
   // test-feature.ts
   import { YourModifiedModule } from './src/domain/your-module';
   
   async function testFeature() {
     // Test your changes directly
     const result = await YourModifiedModule.yourModifiedFunction();
     console.log('Result:', result);
   }
   
   testFeature();
   ```
   
   Run with:
   ```bash
   bun run test-feature.ts
   ```

3. **Set up temporary environment variables if needed**:
   ```bash
   # For testing environment-dependent code
   MINSKY_DEBUG=true bun run ./src/cli.ts your-command
   ```

## Real-World Example

As demonstrated in task #016 (Enforce task operations in main workspace):

1. The `minsky tasks status set` command executed from a session repository used the global installation, not our modified code.
2. We created a test script (`test-workspace-detection.ts`) that imported our modified modules directly.
3. Running `bun run test-workspace-detection.ts` executed our modified code, demonstrating that our changes worked correctly.

## Rule of Thumb

When making changes to Minsky CLI commands in a session repository:
- For quick validation, use `bun run ./src/cli.ts [command]`
- For targeted testing, create and run dedicated test scripts
- Only use the `minsky` command directly when you want to test against the stable/global version

By following these guidelines, you'll avoid confusion and properly validate your changes before submitting your PR.
