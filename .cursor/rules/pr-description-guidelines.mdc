# PR Description Guidelines

For any Pull Request, follow these standards to ensure clarity, consistency, and comprehensive documentation of changes.

## Direct Application Protocol

When a user mentions or references this rule (explicitly or implicitly) in the context of an existing PR:

1. **Default to Direct Improvement**:
   - Immediately locate the corresponding PR description file (typically in `process/tasks/<task-id>/pr.md`)
   - Analyze the existing PR description for missing sections or improvements
   - **Directly update the file** to bring it into compliance with these guidelines
   - Commit and push the changes with an appropriate message (e.g., `docs(#<task-id>): Improve PR description`)

2. **When to Apply vs. Explain**:
   - **Apply Directly**: When a PR description file exists and the user references these guidelines
   - **Explain Only**: When explicitly asked for an explanation or when no PR description exists yet
   - **Both**: When asked to explain what changes would be needed and then implement them

3. **Verification Protocol**:
   - After updating, verify all required sections are present and formatted correctly
   - Ensure special syntax (like nested code blocks) is properly implemented
   - Confirm the changes are committed and pushed to the repository

This protocol aligns with the direct action and automation preferences specified in the user-preferences rule.

## Output Format
When generating a PR description, always wrap it in a markdown code block with the markdown language specifier:
```markdown
# feat(scope): description

## Summary
...rest of PR description...
```

This ensures the formatting is preserved and makes it easy to copy and paste into PR systems.

## Handling Nested Code Blocks
When including code examples within your PR description, you MUST use alternative syntax for nested code blocks to prevent formatting issues:

1. **For the outer markdown code block**: Use standard triple backticks with language specifier: ```markdown

2. **For code examples inside your PR description**: Use one of these approaches:
   - Use indentation (4 spaces) instead of backticks for simple code examples
   - For syntax highlighting in nested blocks, use HTML syntax:
     ```html
     <pre><code class="language-javascript">
     function example() {
       return "This is properly nested";
     }
     </code></pre>
     ```
   - Alternatively, escape the backticks in nested code blocks with HTML entities:
     ```html
     &#96;&#96;&#96;javascript
     function example() {
       return "This is properly nested";
     }
     &#96;&#96;&#96;
     ```

3. **For simple inline code**, continue using single backticks as normal: `example`

## PR Title Format
- Always use the conventional commits format: `type(scope): description`
- For task-related PRs, include the task ID in the scope: `feat(#002): Add per-repo session storage`
- Use appropriate types:
  - `feat`: New features
  - `fix`: Bug fixes
  - `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
  - `docs`: Documentation changes
  - `test`: Adding or modifying tests
  - `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

## PR Description Structure
1. **Summary** (Required)
   - Brief overview of the PR in 2-3 sentences
   - Mention the task ID being implemented

2. **Motivation & Context** (Required)
   - Explain WHY this change is needed
   - Reference the original task specification
   - Describe the problem being solved
   - Include any design constraints or considerations

3. **Design/Approach** (Required)
   - Explain the high-level design or approach chosen
   - Mention any alternative approaches that were considered and why they were rejected
   - Reference any architectural decisions that influenced the implementation

4. **Key Changes** (Required)
   - Bullet points listing significant changes made
   - Group related changes together
   - Use code examples where appropriate for clarity

5. **Breaking Changes** (When applicable)
   - Explicitly call out any breaking changes
   - Detail migration paths for users
   - Provide examples of before/after code if applicable

6. **Data Migrations** (When applicable)
   - Document any data format changes
   - Explain how existing data will be migrated
   - Mention any backward compatibility considerations

7. **Ancillary Changes** (When applicable)
   - List changes made that were not explicitly part of the task
   - Explain why these additional changes were necessary

8. **Testing** (Required)
   - Describe how the changes were tested
   - Mention any new tests added
   - Note any testing limitations or edge cases

9. **Screenshots/Examples** (When applicable)
   - Include visual examples for UI changes
   - Show before/after comparisons if relevant
   - For code examples, use the nested code block techniques described above

## Example PR Description Template with Proper Nesting

```markdown
# feat(#002): Store Session Repos Under Per-Repo Directories

## Summary
This PR implements task #002, reorganizing session storage to use a more structured directory hierarchy and adding repository name tracking.

## Motivation & Context
The current flat session storage structure becomes unwieldy with many sessions from different repositories. This change creates a more organized structure by grouping sessions by repository.

## Design Approach
We've implemented a hierarchical directory structure while maintaining backward compatibility with existing sessions. Repository names are normalized to ensure consistent directory naming across different repository URL formats.

## Key Changes
- Added `repoName` field to `SessionRecord` to track normalized repository names
- Implemented repository name normalization (e.g., `github.com/org/project.git` → `org/project`)
- Updated directory structure to store session repositories under `$XDG_STATE_HOME/minsky/git/<repoName>/sessions/<session>`
- Added migration logic for existing session records

## Code Examples

Example JSON structure:

<pre><code class="language-json">
{
  "session": "task#002",
  "repoName": "org/project",
  "repoUrl": "https://github.com/org/project.git",
  "branch": "task#002",
  "createdAt": "2024-04-29T18:50:00Z"
}
</code></pre>

Example directory structure (4-space indentation for code blocks):

    $XDG_STATE_HOME/minsky/git/
    ├── org/project/
    │   └── sessions/
    │       ├── task#001/
    │       └── task#002/
    └── another/repo/
        └── sessions/
            └── feature-x/

## Breaking Changes
None. All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing sessions.

## Data Migrations
- Existing session records without a `repoName` field will have it automatically populated
- Repositories remain in their original locations but can be migrated using the new `migrateSessionsToSubdirectory` method

## Ancillary Changes
- Improved error handling in session path resolution
- Enhanced workspace detection for better path handling across different environments

## Testing
- Added test cases for repository name normalization
- Added tests for path resolution with both legacy and new structures
- Updated existing tests to work with the new directory structure
```
