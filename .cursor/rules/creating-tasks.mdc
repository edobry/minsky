# Task Creation Process

## Overview
All tasks and work items must be tracked using the canonical process described here. Ad-hoc or freeform task files (e.g., TODO.something.md) are NOT permitted. All tasks must be:
- Listed in `/process/tasks.md` as a checklist item
- Linked to a detailed task spec in `/process/tasks/{id}-{name}.md`

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Check for Existing Tasks
- Before starting any new work, check `/process/tasks.md` for an existing task that matches your intended work.
- If a relevant task exists, follow its linked specification.

### 2. Add a New Task
- If no relevant task exists, add a new checklist item to `/process/tasks.md` using the following format:
  ```markdown
  - [ ] Task Title @#NNN
  ```
  - Use the next available task number (NNN).
  - The title should be concise but descriptive.

### 3. Create the Task Specification
- Create a new file in `/process/tasks/` named `{NNN}-task-title.md`.
- The task spec should include:
  - **Objective**: What is the goal of the task?
  - **Task Breakdown**: A checklist of all required steps and substeps.
  - **Verification**: What must be true for the task to be considered complete?
- Use checkboxes for all actionable items and sub-items.
- Include any relevant context, links, or references.
