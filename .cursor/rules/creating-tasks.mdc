# Task Creation Process

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Task Creation vs. Task Implementation
In Minsky, "creating a task" means authoring a task specification document and adding it to the tracking system - **not** implementing the code for that task.

- When the user requests to "create a task", always produce a task specification document
- Only proceed to implementation if explicitly instructed with phrases like "implement the task" or "write the code for"
- If there is any ambiguity, confirm with the user whether they want task specification or implementation

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Always Check for Existing Tasks First
- Before creating a new task, always check `process/tasks.md` and the `process/tasks/` directory for existing tasks that match the user's request
- If a matching task already exists:
  - Inform the user that the task already exists
  - Provide the task ID and title
  - Review the specification to verify it matches the user's requirements
  - Only create a new task if the existing one doesn't adequately cover the requested functionality
  - Never attempt to implement a task when only asked to create one

## Overview
All tasks and work items must be tracked using the canonical process described here. Ad-hoc or freeform task files (e.g., TODO.something.md) are NOT permitted. All tasks must be:
- Listed in `/process/tasks.md` as a checklist item
- Linked to a detailed task spec in `/process/tasks/{id}-{name}.md`

## Step-by-Step Task Creation Instructions

### 1. Check for Existing Tasks
- Before starting any new work, check `/process/tasks.md` for an existing task that matches your intended work.
- If a relevant task exists, follow its linked specification.

### 2. Add a New Task
- If no relevant task exists, add a new checklist item to `/process/tasks.md` using the following format:
  ```markdown
  - [ ] Task Title [#NNN](mdc:tasks/NNN-task-title.md)
  ```
  - Use the next available task number (NNN).
  - The title should be concise but descriptive.

### 3. Create the Task Specification Document
- Create a new file in `/process/tasks/` named `{NNN}-task-title.md`.
- The task spec should include:
  - **Objective**: What is the goal of the task?
  - **Context**: Background information and why this task is needed
  - **Requirements**: Specific, detailed requirements
  - **Implementation Steps**: A checklist of all required steps and substeps
  - **Verification**: What must be true for the task to be considered complete?
- Use checkboxes for all actionable items and sub-items.
- Include any relevant context, links, or references.

## Complete Example of a Task Specification

Here's a complete example of a properly formatted task specification document:

```markdown
# Task #007: Add `minsky task create` Command

## Context

The Minsky CLI currently lacks a streamlined way to create new tasks from specification documents. Users need to manually update the tasks.md file and ensure proper linking. An automated command would improve workflow efficiency and reduce errors.

## Requirements

1. **CLI Behavior**
   - Command signature:
     ```
     minsky tasks create <spec-path>
     ```
   - The command should:
     - Parse the provided task specification document
     - Extract the title and description
     - Assign the next available ID
     - Add a checklist item to process/tasks.md
     - Return the created task details

2. **Integration with Domain Module**
   - Use the TaskService domain module to record the task
   - Add a createTask method to the TaskService class
   - Implement createTask in the MarkdownTaskBackend

3. **Error Handling**
   - Validate that the spec file exists
   - Ensure the spec file has a valid title and description
   - Handle errors gracefully with informative messages

4. **CLI Options**
   - Support the following options:
     - `--session <session>`: Session name to use for repo resolution
     - `--repo <repoPath>`: Path to a git repository (overrides session)
     - `--backend <backend>`: Specify task backend (markdown, github)
     - `--json`: Output task as JSON

## Implementation Steps

1. [ ] Update TaskBackend interface to include createTask method
2. [ ] Implement createTask in MarkdownTaskBackend:
   - [ ] Parse the spec file to extract title and description
   - [ ] Find the next available task ID
   - [ ] Create a task entry in tasks.md
   - [ ] Return the created Task object
3. [ ] Add createTask method to TaskService
4. [ ] Create a new file in src/commands/tasks/create.ts:
   - [ ] Define command using Commander.js
   - [ ] Add appropriate options and arguments
   - [ ] Implement action handler to call domain method
   - [ ] Add proper error handling
5. [ ] Register command in src/commands/tasks/index.ts
6. [ ] Add tests for the new functionality
7. [ ] Update documentation

## Verification

- [ ] Running `minsky tasks create path/to/spec.md` successfully creates a task
- [ ] The task is added to process/tasks.md with correct formatting
- [ ] The command returns the created task details
- [ ] All options work as expected
- [ ] Error handling works correctly for invalid inputs
- [ ] Tests pass
```

## Task Type Recognition

Always distinguish between:

1. **Task Specification Requests**:
   - "Create a task for..."
   - "Add a task to..."
   - "Make a task that describes..."

2. **Task Implementation Requests**:
   - "Implement the task for..."
   - "Write the code that..."
   - "Let's code the feature for..."

When in doubt, default to creating a task specification document rather than implementing code.
