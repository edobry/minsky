# Task Status Verification Protocol

When investigating or reporting on a task's status, follow these verification steps to ensure accuracy.

## Core Requirements

- **Never rely solely on the tracking system status**
- **Always check both tracking status and implementation status**
- **Report any discrepancies between tracked status and actual implementation**
- **Verify if code has been merged to main branch**
- **Check session status if applicable**

## Verification Steps

1. **Basic Status Check**:
   ```bash
   minsky tasks get <taskId> --json
   ```

2. **Implementation Verification**:
   ```bash
   # Check main branch for relevant commits
   git log --grep="feat(#<taskId>)" --oneline main
   git log --grep="fix(#<taskId>)" --oneline main
   ```

3. **Session Status Check**:
   ```bash
   # Check if session exists
   minsky session get --task <taskId>
   
   # If exists, check branch status
   cd $(minsky session dir <session>)
   git status
   git log -n 5 --oneline
   ```

4. **Discrepancy Resolution**:

   // AVOID
   "Task #123 is in progress."

   // PREFER
   "Task #123 is marked as 'IN-PROGRESS' in the tracking system, but the implementation has been merged to main branch in commit a36f4e8."

5. **Complete Status Report**:

   // AVOID
   "Task #020 is in progress."

   // PREFER
   "Task #020: Official status is 'IN-PROGRESS', but implementation has been merged to main branch (commit a36f4e8). The session still exists but is redundant. Recommend updating task status to 'DONE' and cleaning up the session."

## When to Apply This Protocol

- Responding to direct queries about task status
- Before starting work on a task
- When reporting on project progress
- When determining if a task needs implementation
