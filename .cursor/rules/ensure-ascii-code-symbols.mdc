# Rule: Ensure ASCII Code Symbols

## Description
This rule ensures that all generated code symbols (variable names, function names, class names, constants, identifiers, etc.) STRICTLY use only standard ASCII characters.

## Requirements
1.  **ASCII-Only Symbols**: All code symbols generated by the AI must consist exclusively of standard ASCII characters.
2.  **No Non-ASCII in Symbols**: Non-ASCII characters (e.g., accented letters, Cyrillic, Korean, Chinese characters, emojis, etc.) are strictly prohibited within code symbols.
3.  **Exceptions for Literals**: This rule does NOT apply to:
    *   String literals explicitly provided by the user.
    *   String literals or comments where non-ASCII characters are part of the intended textual content.
    *   Existing code symbols in the codebase that deliberately and verifiably use non-ASCII characters (the AI should mirror existing conventions if explicitly told to do so for specific symbols, but not introduce new ones).
4.  **Verification**: Before outputting code, the AI should internally verify that generated symbols adhere to this rule.
5.  **Application**: This rule `alwaysApply: true` because it is a fundamental requirement for code integrity and predictability from the AI.

## Rationale
To maintain code clarity, prevent compilation or interpretation issues across different environments, and ensure predictable behavior from the AI code generation. This rule was created after an incident where non-ASCII characters were inadvertently introduced into code.

## Examples

// AVOID
function 안녕하세요() { // Korean in function name
  let π = 3.14; // Greek letter in variable name
  const OPTION_Ä = "value"; // Accented character in constant
}

// PREFER
function helloWorld() {
  let pi = 3.14;
  const OPTION_A = "value";
}
