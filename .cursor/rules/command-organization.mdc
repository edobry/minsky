# Command Organization

Each subcommand should be in its own directory under `src/commands/<command-name>/`.

## Directory Structure
- Subcommands should be in their own files under the command directory
- Example: `src/commands/git/clone.ts` for the git clone command
- Main command files should be named `index.ts` in their respective directories
- Avoid putting multiple subcommands in a single file
