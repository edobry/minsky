# Verify Task Number Availability

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Verify Task Number Availability Before Creation

- Before creating any new task, ALWAYS verify that the intended task number is not already in use:
  ```bash
  # List all tasks to check existing task numbers
  minsky tasks list
  ```
- The Minsky task system (not the file system) is the ONLY source of truth for task numbers
- Never assume sequential task numbering without explicit verification
- After identifying the highest existing task number, use the next available number
- This verification step is REQUIRED, not optional
