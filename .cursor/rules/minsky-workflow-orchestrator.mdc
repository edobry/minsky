   - Then: Navigate to the session directory
   - Apply: minsky-session-management

3. **Task Implementation**

### Session-Related Questions

- **"How do I create a session?"**
  → Apply minsky-session-management and use `minsky session start`

- **"How do I get back to my session?"**
  → Apply minsky-session-management and use `minsky session dir`

- **"Why aren't my changes showing up?"**
  → Apply session-first-workflow to verify you're in the correct workspace

### Implementation Questions

- **"How do I implement a task?"**
  → Apply task-implementation-workflow for step-by-step guidance

- **"How do I verify my implementation?"**
  → Apply task-implementation-workflow and tests

- **"How do I create a PR?"**
  → Apply pr-preparation-workflow for PR creation steps

# Minsky Workflow System

This rule provides an overview of the Minsky workflow system and serves as an entry point to the more detailed workflow rules. The Minsky workflow has been divided into focused rules to make it easier to understand and follow.

## Core Workflow Rules

The following rules form the complete Minsky workflow system:

1. [**minsky-cli-usage**](mdc:.cursor/rules/minsky-cli-usage.mdc) - Guidelines for using the Minsky CLI for all task and session operations
2. [**minsky-session-management**](mdc:.cursor/rules/minsky-session-management.mdc) - Procedures for creating and managing sessions
3. [**task-implementation-workflow**](mdc:.cursor/rules/task-implementation-workflow.mdc) - Step-by-step process for implementing tasks
4. [**task-status-protocol**](mdc:.cursor/rules/task-status-protocol.mdc) - Procedures for checking and updating task status
5. [**pr-preparation-workflow**](mdc:.cursor/rules/pr-preparation-workflow.mdc) - Guidelines for preparing and submitting PRs

## Fundamental Principle: CLI-Based Workflow

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: ALL task and session management MUST be done through the Minsky CLI, not through direct file system operations. This includes:

- Task listing, status checking, and status updates
- Session creation, navigation, and management
- Task implementation and verification
- PR preparation and submission

## When to Apply These Rules

These workflow rules should be applied:

- When starting work on a new task
- When checking or updating task status
- When creating or managing sessions
- When implementing task requirements
- When preparing pull requests

## Supporting Rules

The Minsky workflow is supported by these additional rules:

- [**session-first-workflow**](mdc:.cursor/rules/session-first-workflow.mdc) - Ensures all implementation work happens in dedicated sessions
- [**creating-tasks**](mdc:.cursor/rules/creating-tasks.mdc) - Guidelines for creating well-structured task specifications
- [**pr-description-guidelines**](mdc:.cursor/rules/pr-description-guidelines.mdc) - Format and content requirements for PR descriptions
- [**rules-management**](mdc:.cursor/rules/rules-management.mdc) - Guidelines for managing Minsky rules

## Usage Scenarios & Rule Application

### For New Contributors

When a developer first joins the project, they should focus on:

1. Understanding the overall Minsky workflow system (this rule)
2. Learning the session creation and management procedures (minsky-session-management)
3. Becoming familiar with the Minsky CLI commands (minsky-cli-usage)

### When Implementing Features

During feature implementation, the most relevant rules are:

1. The task implementation workflow (task-implementation-workflow)
2. Session management procedures (minsky-session-management)
3. Task status protocol (task-status-protocol)
