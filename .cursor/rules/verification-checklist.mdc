# Verification Checklist

## Core Principle

**NEVER claim a resource doesn't exist without proper verification using available tools.**

## Mandatory Pre-Response Verification

Before claiming ANY resource doesn't exist, complete this checklist:

### 1. File/Resource Search
- [ ] Used `file_search` tool with resource name
- [ ] Checked multiple search terms if initial search fails
- [ ] Verified search covered appropriate directories

### 2. Content-Based Search
- [ ] Used `grep_search` for content-based verification if needed
- [ ] Searched with different patterns/keywords
- [ ] Checked relevant file extensions

### 3. Rule-Specific Verification
- [ ] Used `fetch_rules` tool for rule-related queries
- [ ] Tried alternative rule names if initial fetch fails
- [ ] Verified rule system is accessible

### 4. Documentation
- [ ] Documented search attempts in response
- [ ] Explained what was searched and how
- [ ] Provided evidence of exhaustive search

## Response Templates

### When Resource Found
```
I found the [resource] at [location]. Here's what it contains: [content]
```

### When Resource Not Found (After Verification)
```
I searched for [resource] using [tools used] and checked [locations/patterns searched].
I was unable to find [resource] in the available workspace.
```

## Prohibited Responses

❌ "It looks like there isn't a [resource] available"
❌ "No [resource] found" (without tool usage)
❌ "[Resource] doesn't exist" (without verification)

## Enforcement

- **First violation**: Immediate correction with proper verification
- **Repeat violation**: Critical protocol failure requiring task creation
- **All negative existence claims**: Must show tool usage evidence
