# Minsky CLI Usage Protocol

⛔️ **CRITICAL: ALL TASK AND SESSION OPERATIONS MUST USE THE MINSKY CLI**

## Core Principles

1. **Always Use Minsky CLI for Task/Session Data**
   - NEVER use file listings or static documentation for task/session data
   - NEVER directly manipulate Minsky's state files or databases
   - NEVER delete or modify files in `~/.local/state/minsky/`
   - NEVER read or write to `session-db.json` directly - this is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN
   - ALWAYS use appropriate minsky commands (see Command Reference section below)

2. **Use Official Global Installation**
   - Use the globally installed `minsky` CLI (available on your PATH, typically via `bun link`)
   - **Do NOT use `bun run ...` for task/session operations**
   - Only use `bun run ...` or direct script execution when developing or testing the Minsky CLI itself

3. **Data Integrity is Critical**
   - Minsky maintains critical state in `~/.local/state/minsky/`
   - Direct manipulation of these files will corrupt the system
   - NEVER attempt to "fix" issues by deleting state files
   - Deleting state files is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN as it:
     - Corrupts Minsky's understanding of tasks and sessions
     - Makes session management impossible
     - May lead to lost work or inconsistent state
     - Violates the core principle of CLI-based management
