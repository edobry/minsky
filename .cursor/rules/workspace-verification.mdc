# Workspace Verification

## When to Apply This Rule

Always verify your workspace context and command availability before making any changes to code, configuration, or documentation.

## Core Requirements

- **Verify workspace context** before starting any work
- **Confirm command availability and syntax** before running commands
- **Address all linter errors** in modified files
- **Verify resource management protocols** before editing configuration or metadata files
- **Apply alongside session-first-workflow and minsky-cli-usage rules**

## Workspace Verification Protocol

Before starting any work in a session:

- **Verify Current Working Directory:** Use terminal CWD information, `pwd`, or `ls` commands to confirm you're in the correct session workspace
- **Confirm with Git Status:** Run `git status` to verify you're in the correct branch for the task
- **Directory Structure Check:** Verify the directory structure matches what's expected for a session workspace

## Command Verification Protocol

When using CLI commands, especially Minsky-specific commands:

- **Verify Command Availability:** Always check command availability with `--help` before attempting to use unfamiliar commands
- **Confirm Command Options:** For Minsky commands, verify syntax and options with `minsky <command> --help`
- **Handle Command Errors:** If a command fails, verify syntax using help before proceeding

## Resource Management Verification Protocol

Before modifying project configuration, rules, metadata, or other special resources:

- **Check for Project-Specific Management Tools:** Always verify if the project provides dedicated CLI commands, APIs, or tools for managing specific resources (e.g., `minsky rules` for rule management)
- **Prefer Dedicated Tools Over Direct Editing:** If such tools exist, they MUST be used instead of directly editing files to ensure system integrity and adherence to project conventions
- **Verify Tool Command Syntax:** Use `--help` flags to confirm the correct command syntax for the resource management tool
- **Resource Path Verification:** Confirm the authoritative location for resources, as CLI-managed resources may be stored in locations different from apparent or conventional paths

## Error Handling Protocol

When working with code and tests:

- **Address All Linter Errors:** Acknowledge all linter errors in files you modify
- **Fix Straightforward Errors:** Attempt to fix straightforward linter errors before committing
- **Document Complex Issues:** For complex linter errors, explicitly state limitations when they can't be fixed immediately

## Examples

### ✅ PREFER

```typescript
// First verify workspace
$ pwd
/Users/dev/.local/state/minsky/git/local-minsky/sessions/task#123

// Then verify command availability and options
$ minsky rules --help
Commands:
  minsky rules list                List all rules
  minsky rules get <n>          Get a rule by name
  minsky rules create <n>       Create a new rule
  minsky rules update <n>       Update an existing rule

// Then proceed with command
$ minsky rules list
```

### ❌ AVOID

```typescript
// Assuming command structure without verification
$ minsky rule list
Error: Unknown command: rule

// Making changes without verifying workspace
$ pwd
/Users/dev/Projects/minsky  // Main workspace, not session workspace!
$ vi src/domain/workspace.ts  // Modifying main workspace file!

// Directly editing a rule file instead of using the CLI tool
$ vi .cursor/rules/user-preferences.mdc  // Direct file editing!
// CORRECT: $ minsky rules update user-preferences --description "..." --content path/to/content.md
```

## Related Rules

- Apply alongside [session-first-workflow](mdc:.cursor/rules/session-first-workflow.mdc) for complete session management protocol
- Apply with [minsky-cli-usage](mdc:.cursor/rules/minsky-cli-usage.mdc) when working with Minsky CLI commands
