Rule Name: tests
Description: 
Test Coverage and Quality Requirements:

1. **When to Run Tests**
   - Run tests after ANY change to:
     - Source code files (*.ts, *.js)
     - Test files (*.test.ts, *.spec.ts)
     - Configuration files that affect test behavior
   - Do NOT run tests for:
     - Documentation changes (*.md)
     - Comment-only changes
     - Formatting-only changes (unless they affect test output)

2. **Which Tests to Run**
   - Run all tests in the affected package/module
   - For changes to shared utilities or core functionality, run all tests
   - Use `bun test` for the default test suite
   - Use `bun test --coverage` when making significant changes

3. **Test Success Criteria**
   - All tests must pass (no failures)
   - No new test warnings should be introduced
   - Test coverage should not decrease for modified files
   - Flaky tests should be fixed or marked as such

4. **Test Development**
   - When writing new tests:
     - Only the new/modified test files should be failing
     - Document why tests are failing in the commit message
     - Fix failing tests before completing the change
   - When modifying existing tests:
     - Ensure changes maintain or improve test coverage
     - Update test documentation if behavior changes
     - Consider adding new tests for edge cases

5. **Test Environment**
   - Run tests in the development environment
   - Ensure all required dependencies are installed
   - Document any environment-specific requirements

6. **Test Reporting**
   - Document any skipped tests and why
   - Note any changes to test coverage
   - Flag any new test warnings or flaky tests
