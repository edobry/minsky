# Changelog Rule

## Rule Name: changelog

## Description

For any code change, **record it in the `CHANGELOG.md` file in the nearest ancestor directory that contains a `CHANGELOG.md`**.

- If the file you changed is in a subdirectory with its own `CHANGELOG.md`, use that changelog.
- If there is no `CHANGELOG.md` in the current or any parent directory, use the root `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Never update more than one changelog for a single change. Always use the most specific (deepest) changelog file in the directory tree.

### Examples

| File Changed                              | Changelog to Update         |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `synthase/src/commands/tools/constants.ts`| `synthase/CHANGELOG.md`    |
| `synthase/src/utils/tools.ts`             | `synthase/CHANGELOG.md`    |
| `README.md` (root)                        | `CHANGELOG.md`             |
| `docs/usage.md`                           | `CHANGELOG.md`             |

## Additional Guidance
- Only update the `CHANGELOG.md` at the end of an editing session, after testing whether the change worked.
- If a change affects multiple directories with their own changelogs, split the changelog entries accordingly, but never duplicate the same entry in multiple changelogs.
- For documentation-only changes, use the root changelog unless the documentation is scoped to a subproject with its own changelog.

## Rationale
This ensures that changelog entries are always relevant to the part of the codebase they affect, and avoids ambiguity about where to record changes.
