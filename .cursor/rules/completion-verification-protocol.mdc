# Completion Verification Protocol

## Rule Name: completion-verification-protocol

## Description

**NEVER declare a task complete or successful without verifying all quantifiable success criteria are met.**

This rule was created after Task #305 where completion was prematurely declared while 217 Jest patterns remained (ESLint still detecting violations).

## Critical Failure Pattern Identified

**Pattern**: Declaring "successfully completed" or "working" when measurable metrics show work remaining.

**Example Violation**: 
- Claiming "ESLint rule re-enabled" when ESLint still reports 217 violations
- Saying "migration completed" when grep shows 189 patterns remaining
- Declaring "verified working" without running the actual verification command

## Mandatory Verification Protocol

**BEFORE declaring ANY task complete:**

1. ✅ **Run quantifiable verification**: Execute the specific commands that measure success
2. ✅ **Check ALL success criteria**: Verify every requirement in task specification  
3. ✅ **Show actual numbers**: Report the specific metric (0 violations, 0 patterns, etc.)
4. ✅ **Test functionality**: Verify changes don't break existing functionality

## Required Verification Commands

For Jest migration tasks:
```bash
# MUST show 0 for completion
bun lint 2>&1 | grep "custom/no-jest-patterns" | wc -l
grep -r "\.mockResolvedValue\|\.mockReturnValue" --include="*.ts" src/ | wc -l
```

For any rule re-enablement:
```bash
# MUST show 0 violations for the specific rule
bun lint 2>&1 | grep "[rule-name]" | wc -l
```

## Status Language Requirements

❌ **FORBIDDEN without verification**:
- "Successfully completed"
- "Working correctly" 
- "Migration completed"
- "Rule re-enabled"

✅ **REQUIRED for partial progress**:
- "Partial progress: X→Y patterns remaining"
- "In progress: N violations remain"
- "Approaching completion: M issues left"

✅ **ONLY after verification shows 0**:
- "Verified complete: 0 violations detected"
- "Confirmed working: all tests pass"

## Task-Specific Success Criteria

**Jest Migration Task (#305)**:
- ✅ ESLint `custom/no-jest-patterns` reports 0 violations
- ✅ grep for Jest patterns returns 0 matches
- ✅ Test suite passes without Jest-related errors
- ✅ All transformations use proper Bun syntax

## Enforcement Mechanism

**Before ANY completion claim:**
1. Execute verification commands
2. Show actual output/numbers
3. Only proceed if ALL metrics show success criteria met
4. If ANY metric fails → continue work, update status accurately

## Critical Reminder

**This systematic error severely undermines trust and effectiveness.** Quantifiable verification is not optional - it is mandatory before any success declaration.
