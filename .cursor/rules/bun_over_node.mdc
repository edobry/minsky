Always use `bun` instead of `node` when running JavaScript/TypeScript in the Synthase project. Bun is the preferred runtime for Synthase.

Examples:
- Use `bun install` instead of `npm install`
- Use `bun run` instead of `node`
- Use `bun test` instead of `jest` or `mocha`
- Use `bun build` instead of other build tools

When writing documentation, commands, or implementation code, always prefer Bun's API and CLI over Node.js equivalents. The project is specifically designed to leverage Bun's performance and capabilities.

In package.json scripts, ensure all commands use bun:
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "bun run src/index.ts",
  "dev": "bun --watch src/index.ts",
  "build": "bun build src/index.ts --outdir dist",
  "test": "bun test"
}
```

When creating new files, use the bun shebang:
```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env bun
```

This rule applies to all code, documentation, and configuration files in the Synthase project.
