# Minsky Workflow

⛔️ **STOP - READ THIS FIRST**

## Mandatory Session Creation

**NO IMPLEMENTATION WORK CAN BEGIN WITHOUT AN ACTIVE SESSION**

Before implementing ANY task or making ANY code changes, you MUST:

```bash
# 1. Check task status
minsky tasks status get '#XXX'

# 2. Create or verify session exists
minsky session start --task XXX

# 3. Enter session directory
cd $(minsky session dir task#XXX)
```

❌ If these steps are not completed:
- DO NOT make any code changes
- DO NOT commit any files
- DO NOT proceed with implementation

✅ These activities are allowed without a session:
- Reading code
- Searching the codebase
- Investigating issues
- Planning implementation
- Creating new task specifications

This is a HARD REQUIREMENT for all implementation work. There are NO EXCEPTIONS.

⚠️ **CRITICAL: ALL TASK AND SESSION QUERIES MUST USE THE MINSKY CLI**
⚠️ **CRITICAL: ALL COMMITS MUST BE PUSHED IMMEDIATELY**

This rule defines the comprehensive process for working with tasks and sessions using the Minsky tool. ANY operation related to tasks or sessions - whether viewing, querying, or modifying - MUST use the Minsky CLI to ensure data consistency and accuracy.

## Core Principles

1. **Always Use Minsky CLI for Task/Session Data**
   - NEVER use file listings or static documentation
   - NEVER directly manipulate Minsky's state files or databases
   - NEVER delete or modify files in `~/.local/state/minsky/`
   - NEVER read or write to `session-db.json` directly - this is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN
   - ALWAYS use appropriate minsky commands:
     ```bash
     # For task queries
     minsky tasks list --json          # List all tasks
     minsky tasks get '#XXX' --json    # Get specific task details
     minsky tasks status get '#XXX'    # Get task status
     
     # For session queries
     minsky session list --json        # List all sessions
     minsky session get <name>         # Get session details by name
     minsky session get --task XXX     # Get session details by task ID
     ```

2. **Data Integrity is Critical**
   - Minsky maintains critical state in `~/.local/state/minsky/`
   - Direct manipulation of these files will corrupt the system
   - NEVER attempt to "fix" issues by deleting state files
   - NEVER attempt to read or modify the session database directly
   - If encountering session/task issues:
     1. Use `minsky session list` to check current state
     2. Use `minsky session get <name>` to inspect specific sessions by name
     3. Use `minsky session get --task XXX` to inspect sessions by task ID
     4. Report the issue if commands aren't working as expected
   - Deleting state files is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN as it:
     - Corrupts Minsky's understanding of tasks and sessions
     - Makes session management impossible
     - May lead to lost work or inconsistent state
     - Violates the core principle of CLI-based management

3. **Real-Time Data Over Static Files**
   - Task information comes from the live system, not files
   - Session state must be queried through CLI, not assumed
   - File system should never be used as a primary data source

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: SESSION-FIRST IMPLEMENTATION

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: A SESSION MUST BE CREATED AND ACTIVE BEFORE ANY CODE CHANGES**

Before examining or modifying any code, you MUST:
1. Verify task status (`minsky tasks status get '#id'`)
2. Create or identify an existing session (`minsky session start --task id`)
3. Enter the session directory (`cd $(minsky session dir session-name)`)

No code examination or changes are permitted until these steps are complete.
Violating this rule compromises the entire workflow system.

## ⚠️ REPOSITORY ISOLATION WARNING

**The session directory contains a COMPLETELY SEPARATE CLONE of the repository.**

- Changes made to files in the main workspace WILL NOT appear in the session branch
- Changes made to files in the session directory DO NOT affect the main workspace
- Always confirm your current working directory with `pwd` before making any changes
- Session isolation is fundamental to the Minsky model and must be preserved

## FILE PATH RESOLUTION REQUIREMENTS

When working in a session directory, you MUST:

- **ALWAYS use absolute paths when editing files**
  - CORRECT: `/Users/username/.local/state/minsky/git/task-id/src/file.ts`
  - INCORRECT: `src/file.ts` (which would edit the main workspace file)
- Relative paths in file editing tools are resolved against the main workspace, NOT the current shell directory
- Without absolute paths, changes may silently occur in the main workspace instead of the session directory

## FILE CHANGE VERIFICATION

After every file edit in a session directory, verify the changes are actually present by:

1. Running `git status` to confirm the file appears as modified
2. Running `git diff <filename>` to confirm the expected changes exist
3. Never assuming an edit succeeded without verification

## Request Interpretation and Workflow Priority

1. **Always interpret requests based on their literal meaning in the project context**
   - "Create a task" means creating a task specification document, not implementing code
   - "Implement" or "code" refers to writing the actual implementation
   - When in doubt, default to task specification over implementation

2. **Request Type Recognition**
   - Categorize requests as either "specifying work" or "implementing work"
   - Each category requires different response patterns:
     - Specifying work → create task specification documents
     - Implementing work → write code following existing specifications
   - Never implement code until the specification is verified

3. **When to Request Clarification**
   - If a request could be interpreted multiple ways, ask for clarification
   - Examples of ambiguous requests requiring clarification:
     - "Work on task #123" (specify or implement?)
     - "Handle the task creation feature" (create spec or code?)
     - "Add the minsky task create command" (create spec or implement?)
   - Always err on the side of creating task specifications when unclear

4. **Clear vs. Ambiguous Request Examples**
   - Clear Specification Request: "Create a task to add a minsky task create command"
     → Create a task specification document
   - Clear Implementation Request: "Implement the minsky task create command according to task #007"  
     → Implement the code following the specification
   - Ambiguous Request: "Add the minsky task create command"
     → Default to creating a task specification unless context clearly indicates implementation

**Automation Directive:** Whenever you are asked about the current state of tasks, sessions, or any live project data, always run the appropriate `minsky` CLI command (e.g., `minsky tasks list --json`, `minsky tasks status get <id>`, etc.) to retrieve real-time information. Do not rely solely on static documentation, code, or cached data for these queries. Only supplement with documentation or codebase details if the CLI output is insufficient or ambiguous. This ensures all answers reflect the actual, current state of the project.

## Task Selection and Initial Setup

When asked to work on a task (by name, description, or ID):

1. **Find or Access the Task**
   - If you already know the task ID (e.g., "001" or "#001"):
     ```bash
     # Get direct information about a specific task
     minsky tasks get '#001' --json
     ```
   - If you need to find a task from the backlog:  When asked to list, filter, or check the status of tasks, always run:
     ```bash
     minsky tasks list --json
     ```
     and present the output directly, unless specifically instructed otherwise.
     > **Note:** Always use `jq` for JSON parsing, not `grep`. This is a general best practice for all projects.

2. **Check Task Status**
   - Before starting any work, check the current status of the task:
     ```bash
     minsky tasks status get '#001'
     ```
   - Task status meanings:
     - `TODO`: Not started, available to work on
     - `IN-PROGRESS`: Work has begun but is not complete
     - `IN-REVIEW`: Work is complete and awaiting review
     - `DONE`: Work is complete, reviewed, and merged
   - If the task is already marked as `DONE` or `IN-REVIEW`, confirm with the user before proceeding.

3. **Understand Requirements**
   - Read the task specification document shown in the output of `minsky tasks get`
   - The path is typically `process/tasks/<task-id>-<task-name>.md` (e.g., `process/tasks/001-update-session-start.md`)
   - Ensure all requirements and acceptance criteria are clearly understood
   - Note any dependencies or blocking issues

## Creating New Tasks

When asked to create a new task:

1. **Refer to the creating-tasks rule**
   - See detailed instructions in the `creating-tasks.mdc` rule
   - Never implement code when asked to create a task unless explicitly instructed
   - Always create a well-formatted task specification document

2. **Checklist Steps for Task Creation**
   - Create a task specification document following the standardized format
   - Add the task to the main task list in `/process/tasks.md`
   - Use the next available task ID
   - Link the task correctly following project conventions

## Session Management

### Starting a New Session

1. **Create a Task Session**
   - Begin a new session for the task (no session name needed when using `--task`):
     ```bash
     minsky session start --task 001
     ```
   - Use the `--quiet` option for programmatic usage that outputs only the session directory path:
     ```bash
     # For programmatic use in scripts
     SESSION_DIR=$(minsky session start --task 001 --quiet)
     cd "$SESSION_DIR"
     ```
   - The standard output will show:
     - The auto-generated session name (e.g., `task#001`)
     - The repository location where files were cloned
     - The branch name that was created (same as session name)
     - The task ID association
     - Command to navigate to the session directory
     - The session directory path (for programmatic use)

2. **Enter the Session Directory**
   - Navigate to the session directory using the provided command

### Re-entering an Existing Session

When asked to continue working on a task:

1. **Find Existing Session**
   - Look up the session associated with the task:
     ```bash
     # Use session get to get details about a specific session by name
     minsky session get task#001
     
     # OR use session get with the --task option to get details by task ID
     minsky session get --task 001
     ```
   - If needed, you can also list all sessions:
     ```bash
     minsky session list --json
     ```

2. **Enter Existing Session**
   - Navigate to the session directory:
     ```bash
     cd $(minsky session dir task#001)
     ```
   - If no session exists, create one as described in "Starting a New Session"

### Programmatic Usage

When integrating minsky into automated workflows or scripts:

1. **Use `--quiet` for Machine-Readable Output**
   - The `--quiet` option provides clean, machine-readable output:
     ```bash
     # Create a session and capture its directory path
     SESSION_DIR=$(minsky session start --task 001 --quiet)
     
     # Use the path in a script
     cd "$SESSION_DIR"
     echo "Working in session directory: $SESSION_DIR"
     
     # Use with other options
     SESSION_DIR=$(minsky session start my-session --repo https://github.com/org/repo.git --quiet)
     ```

2. **Error Handling in Scripts**
   - Even in quiet mode, errors are sent to stderr and exit codes are set appropriately:
     ```bash
     # Example bash script with error handling
     if SESSION_DIR=$(minsky session start --task 001 --quiet); then
       cd "$SESSION_DIR"
       echo "Successfully started session in: $SESSION_DIR"
     else
       echo "Failed to start session, exiting" >&2
       exit 1
     fi
     ```

3. **Combining with Other Commands**
   - Chain with other minsky commands for complex workflows:
     ```bash
     # Example: Create session, run tests, and generate PR description
     SESSION_DIR=$(minsky session start --task 001 --quiet)
     cd "$SESSION_DIR"
     bun test
     
     if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
       minsky git pr --path . > process/tasks/001/pr.md
       git add process/tasks/001/pr.md
       git commit -m "task#001: Add PR description"
       git push origin "$(git branch --show-current)"
       minsky tasks status set '#001' IN-REVIEW
     fi
     ```

## Implementation Process

1. **Planning**
   - Review the task document to ensure full understanding
   - For a new task, draft an implementation plan and append it to the task document
   - For continuing work, review the task's "Work Log" section to see progress

2. **Implementation**
   - Follow all project coding standards and best practices
   - Implement the required changes, addressing all requirements
   - Commit changes at logical intervals with clear, descriptive messages
   - Reference the task ID in all commit messages (e.g., "task#001: Implement feature X")
   - **ALWAYS push immediately after committing:**
     ```bash
     # After every commit, immediately push to the session branch
     git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
     ```
   - Never leave commits unpushed at the end of an implementation session

3. **Work Log**
   - Maintain a "Work Log" section in the task document:
     ```markdown
     ## Work Log
     - YYYY-MM-DD: Implemented X feature
     - YYYY-MM-DD: Fixed Y bug
     - YYYY-MM-DD: Added tests for Z functionality
     ```
   - This log will be used to update the changelog when the task is complete

4. **Testing**
   - Write appropriate tests for all new functionality
   - Ensure all existing tests continue to pass
   - Document any complex test scenarios or edge cases addressed

## Verification and Documentation

1. **Verification**
   - Verify that all requirements have been implemented correctly
   - Check off completed verification steps in the task document by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`
   - Ensure that all tests pass

2. **Documentation**
   - Update the task document with implementation details
   - Document any design decisions or compromises made during implementation
   - Update any relevant project documentation

3. **Changelog**
   - Follow the instructions in the [changelog rule](mdc:changelog.mdc) for updating the appropriate CHANGELOG.md
   - Use the Work Log from the task document as the basis for changelog entries
   - Reference the task ID in the changelog entry

## Task Completion Checklist

Task implementation is not complete until ALL these steps are performed, in order:

1. ✓ All code changes are made in the session directory (not main workspace)
2. ✓ All tests pass in the session directory
3. ✓ Task document is updated with Work Log and verification steps are checked off
4. ✓ All changes are committed with task ID in commit message
5. ✓ PR description is generated using `minsky git pr` and saved to `process/tasks/<task-id>/pr.md`
6. ✓ PR description is committed
7. ✓ Changes are pushed to remote with `git push origin <branch>`
8. ✓ Task status is updated to IN-REVIEW using `minsky tasks status set '#id' IN-REVIEW`

## PR Preparation

1. **Generate a PR description:**
   ```bash
   minsky git pr --path .
   ```
   - Minsky will automatically generate a PR description based on the changes in the current branch
   - Save this description to:
     ```
     process/tasks/<task-id>/pr.md
     ```
   - Commit this PR description file

2. **Finalization**
   - Push your branch:
     ```bash
     # Current approach (standard git command)
     git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
     
     # Future: Will be simplified with dedicated command (Task #005)
     # minsky git push
     ```
   - Note: Task #005 is in progress to simplify this step with a dedicated command

3. **Status Update**
   - Update the task status to the appropriate state:
     ```bash
     # Use IN-REVIEW after you've generated a PR and pushed your changes
     minsky tasks status set '#001' IN-REVIEW
     
     # Use DONE only after the changes have been reviewed and merged
     minsky tasks status set '#001' DONE
     ```

## Important Notes

- Never skip verification steps or mark a task complete without meeting all requirements
- Always check the existing task status before beginning work
- Reference the task number in all PRs, commits, and documentation
- Maintain a Work Log in the task document to track implementation progress
- If modifications to the requirements are needed, discuss and document them in the task document
- When a task spans multiple sessions, use the Work Log to ensure continuity
- Minsky manages branch names, session directories, and other infrastructure—you don't need to create these manually

> **Triggering the Minsky CLI for Task/Session Queries**
>
> For any user query that asks about the existence, availability, status, or list of tasks or sessions, you MUST use the minsky CLI to retrieve live data. This includes, but is not limited to, queries such as:
> - "What tasks are available?"
> - "List all tasks"
> - "Show open/in-progress/done tasks"
> - "What sessions exist?"
> - "What is the status of task #007?"
> - "Which tasks are in the backlog?"
>
> **Do NOT** answer these queries by listing files or reading static documentation. **Always** run the appropriate minsky CLI command (e.g., `minsky tasks list --json`) and present the output directly.
