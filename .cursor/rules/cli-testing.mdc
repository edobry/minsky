# CLI Testing

When testing command-line interfaces, follow these practices for thorough and reliable tests:

## End-to-End CLI Testing
- Use `spawnSync` or similar to test the CLI as users would experience it
- Test the full command invocation rather than just internal functions
- Set up the environment to mimic a real user's environment
- Verify both successful execution and proper error handling
- Include tests of usage information and help text

```typescript
const { stdout, stderr, status } = spawnSync('bun', ['run', CLI, 'command', 'subcommand', '--flag'], { 
  encoding: 'utf-8',
  env: { ...process.env, CUSTOM_VAR: 'value' } 
});

expect(status).toBe(0); // Successful exit
expect(stdout).toContain('Expected output');
expect(stderr).toBe(''); // No errors
```

## Output Format Testing
- Test both human-readable and machine-readable outputs (e.g., JSON)
- Verify text formatting, colors, and layout when important for UX
- Test all output modes and formats the CLI provides
- Parse and validate structured output (JSON, CSV, etc.)
- Test output in both TTY and non-TTY environments when relevant

```typescript
// Test human-readable output
const { stdout: textOut } = spawnSync('bun', ['run', CLI, 'command']);
expect(textOut).toContain('Human readable result:');

// Test JSON output
const { stdout: jsonOut } = spawnSync('bun', ['run', CLI, 'command', '--json']);
const result = JSON.parse(jsonOut);
expect(result.success).toBe(true);
expect(result.data).toHaveProperty('key');
```

## Testing CLI Flags and Options
- Test each flag and option individually
- Test combinations of flags that should work together
- Test flags that are mutually exclusive
- Test default values when flags are omitted
- Test invalid or incompatible flag combinations

## Input Validation Testing
- Test with valid, invalid, and edge case inputs
- Test handling of missing required arguments
- Test input type validation (numbers, dates, etc.)
- Test path resolution and existence checks
- Test handling of unexpected input formats

## Exit Code Testing
- Verify correct exit codes for success and various error conditions
- Test exit code 0 for successful operations
- Test specific non-zero exit codes for different error types
- Document the meaning of each exit code

```typescript
const { status } = spawnSync('bun', ['run', CLI, 'command', '--invalid-flag']);
expect(status).toBe(1); // Error exit code
```

## Testing Interactive CLI Features

**IMPORTANT**: Testing of detailed interactive CLI features (e.g., simulating user input for prompts from libraries like `@clack/prompts`) is generally discouraged due to brittleness and focus on framework internals over domain logic.

-   **Refer to the `@testing-boundaries.mdc` rule for comprehensive guidelines on what should and should not be tested regarding interactive CLI behavior.**
-   Instead of simulating interactive prompts, focus on testing the underlying command logic or action handlers by directly providing them with the data that an interactive prompt would have gathered.
-   If a command's behavior changes based on interactive input, test the functions responsible for that logic with various inputs, rather than testing the interactive sequence itself.

## Environment Testing
- Test with different environment variables
- Verify proper handling of configuration files
- Test with various working directories
- Test permission and access scenarios
- Test platform-specific behavior when relevant

## Integration with Other Commands
- Test how your CLI interacts with other tools in pipelines
- Test input/output redirection
- Test exit code propagation in scripts
- Verify handling of signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM, etc.)

These practices ensure your CLI tools are robust, user-friendly, and behave as expected in real-world usage scenarios.
