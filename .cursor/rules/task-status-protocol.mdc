# Task Status Protocol

This rule defines the standard protocol for checking, updating, and verifying task status within the Minsky system.

## Task Status Lifecycle

Tasks in the Minsky system progress through the following statuses:

- `TODO`: Not started, available to work on
- `IN-PROGRESS`: Work has begun but is not complete
- `IN-REVIEW`: Work is complete and awaiting review
- `DONE`: Work is complete, reviewed, and merged
