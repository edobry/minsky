# Operational Safety: Dry-Run First

Keep potentially destructive operations safe by default.

## Requirements
- Default to preview/dry-run; perform changes only when user passes an explicit `--execute` flag.
- Reflect this behavior in CLI help, docs, and package scripts.
- Show a clear preview plan for what would happen before applying.
- Provide a follow-up example with `--execute`.

## Examples

// AVOID: applying by default
```
minsky sessiondb migrate
# applies immediately
```

// PREFER: safe default with explicit execution
```
# preview
minsky sessiondb migrate --dry-run

# apply (must be explicit)
minsky sessiondb migrate --execute
```

## Cross-References
- See `sessiondb.migrate` behavior and other commands using `--execute` semantics.
