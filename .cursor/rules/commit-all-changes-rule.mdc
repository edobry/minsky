# Commit All Changes Rule

## Core Principle

Always commit and push all code changes without waiting for an explicit request from the user. This rule ensures that every change made is properly persisted to the repository.

## Requirements

1. After implementing any feature, fix, or update:
   - Stage all changed files
   - Commit with a descriptive message following conventional commits format
   - Push the changes to the remote repository

2. Never consider a task complete until changes have been:
   - Committed to the local repository
   - Pushed to the remote repository

3. This applies to ALL changes:
   - Code fixes
   - Feature implementations
   - Documentation updates
   - Configuration changes
   - Rule updates
   - Task management operations

## Verification Checklist

Before considering any implementation complete, verify:
- [ ] All changes are staged
- [ ] Changes are committed with a descriptive message
- [ ] Changes are pushed to the remote repository
