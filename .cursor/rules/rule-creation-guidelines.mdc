# Cursor Rule Creation Guidelines

Rules are read by AI assistants with limited attention spans and context windows. Every word must count.

## Core Principles

- **Rule Follower Perspective**: Write rules imagining you are the AI following them
- **Concision**: Be direct and brief; limit each rule to exactly what's needed
- **Modularity**: Create focused rules targeting specific situations
- **Clarity**: Use simple language and clear examples
- **Hierarchy**: Structure content from most to least important
- **No Duplication**: Never repeat content across rules
## Rule Structure

1. **Metadata Header (Required)**
   ```markdown
   ---
   description: Brief, actionable summary triggering rule application
   globs: ["file/patterns/*.ts"] 
   alwaysApply: false
   ---
   ```

2. **Title**: Clear, concise name using `# Title` format

3. **Introduction**: 1-2 sentences summarizing purpose

4. **Core Principles/Requirements**: Bulleted list of key points

5. **Examples**: Contrasting good/bad patterns with labels:
   ```
   // AVOID
   badExample();
   
   // PREFER
   goodExample();
   ```

6. **Rationale**: Only if not self-evident from principles
## File Location

**RULE FILES MUST BE STORED IN THE `.cursor/rules` DIRECTORY AT THE ROOT OF THE PROJECT.**

- Correct path: `<project_root>/.cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc`
- Never create rules in any other location

## Writing the Description Field

The description is **critically important** as it's the main trigger for rule application:

- Begin with "Use when..." or "Guidelines for..." to clearly state when the rule applies
- Include all relevant trigger keywords (e.g., "required for testing components")
- Specify file types or contexts where the rule applies
- Use "REQUIRED" or "MUST" for non-negotiable rules
- Keep under 100 characters while remaining specific
- Test by asking: "Would an AI correctly apply this rule based solely on this description?"
## Rule Assessment Checklist

Before submitting a rule, verify it:

- [ ] Has a precise description that clearly indicates when it applies
- [ ] Contains no information duplicated in other rules
- [ ] Uses clear, specific language without ambiguity
- [ ] Provides concrete examples of correct and incorrect patterns
- [ ] Is structured from most to least important information
- [ ] Could be correctly applied by someone with limited attention
- [ ] Would be triggered by the correct glob patterns

## Anti-patterns

- **Verbose Introductions**: Don't waste words explaining the rule exists
- **Duplicate Content**: Never repeat information found in other rules
- **Vague Descriptions**: Avoid general terms like "best practices" without specifics
- **Nested Complexity**: Keep rule structure flat and scannable
- **Excessive Context**: Focus on directives, not background information
- **Mixed Concerns**: Each rule should govern exactly one area of concern
