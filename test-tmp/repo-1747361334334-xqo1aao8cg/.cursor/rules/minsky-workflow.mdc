# Minsky Workflow

⛔️ **STOP - READ THIS FIRST**

## Mandatory Session Creation

**NO IMPLEMENTATION WORK CAN BEGIN WITHOUT AN ACTIVE SESSION**

Before implementing ANY task or making ANY code changes, you MUST:

```bash
# 1. Check task status
minsky tasks status get '#XXX'

# 2. Create or verify session exists
minsky session start --task XXX

# 3. Enter session directory
cd $(minsky session dir task#XXX)
```

❌ If these steps are not completed:
- DO NOT make any code changes
- DO NOT commit any files
- DO NOT proceed with implementation

✅ These activities are allowed without a session:
- Reading code
- Searching the codebase
- Investigating issues
- Planning implementation
- Creating new task specifications

This is a HARD REQUIREMENT for all implementation work. There are NO EXCEPTIONS.

⚠️ **CRITICAL: ALL TASK AND SESSION QUERIES MUST USE THE MINSKY CLI**
⚠️ **CRITICAL: ALL COMMITS MUST BE PUSHED IMMEDIATELY**

## Core Principles

1. **Always Use Minsky CLI for Task/Session Data**
   - NEVER use file listings or static documentation
   - NEVER directly manipulate Minsky's state files or databases
   - ALWAYS use appropriate minsky commands:
     ```bash
     # For task queries
     minsky tasks list --json          # List all tasks
     minsky tasks get '#XXX' --json    # Get specific task details
     minsky tasks status get '#XXX'    # Get task status
     
     # For session queries
     minsky session list --json        # List all sessions
     minsky session get <n>            # Get session details by name
     minsky session get --task XXX     # Get session details by task ID
     ```

2. **Real-Time Data Over Static Files**
   - Task information comes from the live system, not files
   - Session state must be queried through CLI, not assumed
   - File system should never be used as a primary data source

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: SESSION-FIRST IMPLEMENTATION

A session MUST be created and active before any code changes. Before examining or modifying any code, you MUST:
1. Verify task status (`minsky tasks status get '#id'`)
2. Create or identify an existing session (`minsky session start --task id`)
3. Enter the session directory (`cd $(minsky session dir session-name)`)

## Repository Isolation Warning

**The session directory contains a COMPLETELY SEPARATE CLONE of the repository.**

- Changes made to files in the main workspace WILL NOT appear in the session branch
- Changes made to files in the session directory DO NOT affect the main workspace
- Always confirm your current working directory with `pwd` before making any changes
