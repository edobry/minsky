/**
 * MCP Rules Adapter Integration Tests
 * @migrated Already using native Bun patterns
 * @refactored Uses project utilities and proper TypeScript imports
 *
 * NOTE: This test file demonstrates basic integration patterns but requires
 * advanced mocking infrastructure for complete functionality testing.
 * Complex mocking of readonly properties and module constructors is documented
 * in the migration notes for future infrastructure improvements.
