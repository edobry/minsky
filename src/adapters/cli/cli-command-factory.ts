 * CLI Command Factory - Import Hub
 * @migrated Converted to import hub after extracting components to focused modules
 * @architecture Follows the established modularization pattern
 *
 * Factory for creating CLI commands from shared commands using the CLI bridge.
 *
 * This is the ONLY recommended way to create CLI commands from shared commands.
 * It ensures proper customizations are applied and provides a consistent interface.
