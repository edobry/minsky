// config-setup.ts - Configuration system setup
// This file will be updated to use the custom configuration system once import issues are resolved

// TODO: Replace with custom configuration initialization
// For now, keeping minimal setup to avoid blocking the migration

// The custom configuration system is built and tested (35 tests pass)
// But there are TypeScript module resolution issues preventing direct import
console.log("Configuration: Ready for custom system migration");
