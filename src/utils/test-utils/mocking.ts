/**
 * Test Mocking Utilities - Import Hub
 * @migrated Converted to import hub after extracting components to focused modules
 * @architecture Follows the established modularization pattern
 *
 * Centralized test mocking utilities for consistent test patterns across the codebase.
 * These utilities encapsulate Bun's testing mocking patterns for easier and consistent mocking.
 *
 * This module provides utilities to:
 * - Create mock functions with proper type safety
 * - Mock entire modules with custom implementations
 * - Set up automatic mock cleanup for tests
 * - Create mock objects with multiple mock methods
 * - Create specialized mocks for common Node.js modules
 *
