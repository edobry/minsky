/**
 * NOTE: These tests are temporarily disabled due to issues with mocking.
 * 
 * The GitHub backend tests require sophisticated mocking of:
 * - fs/promises (for file operations)
 * - child_process exec (for git commands)
 * - SessionDB (for session management)
 * - GitService (for git operations)
 * 
 * This test suite will be reimplemented after improving the test utilities.
