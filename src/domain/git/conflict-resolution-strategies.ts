üóëÔ∏è  Deleted file conflicts detected

Files deleted in main branch but modified in your session:
${deletedFiles.map((f) => `  ‚Ä¢ ${f}`).join("\n")}

These conflicts are typically auto-resolvable by accepting the deletion.
The files were removed for a reason (likely part of refactoring or cleanup).

Recommended action: Accept the deletions and remove your changes to these files.

  case ConflictType.CONTENT_CONFLICT:

‚úèÔ∏è  Content conflicts detected

${
  conflictFiles.length
} file(s) have conflicting changes between your session and main branch.
These require manual resolution by editing the files and choosing which changes to keep.

üìã Next Steps:
1. Run: git status                    (see which files are conflicted)
2. Edit the conflicted files          (look for <<<<<<< markers)
3. Run: git add <file>               (mark conflicts as resolved)
4. Run: git commit                    (complete the merge)
5. Run: minsky session pr [options]   (retry PR creation)

üîß Quick Check:
‚Ä¢ Run 'git status' now to see the conflicted files
‚Ä¢ Edit files and remove conflict markers
‚Ä¢ Choose which changes to keep between <<<<<<< and >>>>>>>

Look for conflict markers:
  <<<<<<< HEAD (your changes)
  =======
  >>>>>>> main (main branch changes)

  case ConflictType.ALREADY_MERGED:
    return `
‚úÖ Changes already merged

Your session changes appear to already be present in the main branch.
You can skip the update step and proceed directly to PR creation.
        `.trim();

  default:

Manual resolution is required. Please review the conflicted files and resolve them manually.
