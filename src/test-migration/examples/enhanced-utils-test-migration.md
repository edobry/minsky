# Test Migration: enhanced-utils.test.ts

## File Information

- **File Path**: `src/utils/test-utils/__tests__/enhanced-utils.test.ts`
- **Migration Difficulty**: Easy
- **Mocking Complexity**: Low
- **Test Type**: Unit

## Before & After Analysis

### Code Comparison

```typescript
// BEFORE MIGRATION
import { describe, test, expect } from "bun:test";
import {
  createMock,
  createPartialMock,
  mockFunction,
  mockReadonlyProperty,
  createSpyOn,
  createTestSuite,
  withCleanup,
} from "../mocking";
// other imports...

// AFTER MIGRATION
import { describe, test, expect, beforeEach, afterEach } from "bun:test";
import {
  createMock,
  createPartialMock,
  mockFunction,
  mockReadonlyProperty,
  createSpyOn,
  createTestSuite,
  withCleanup,
} from "../mocking.js";
// other imports with .js extensions...
```

### Key Changes

- Added explicit imports for `beforeEach` and `afterEach` from `bun:test`
- Added `.js` file extensions to all relative imports to comply with ESM import requirements
- Fixed TypeScript path references

## Migration Patterns Used

- **Import Fixes**: Updated imports to explicitly include all needed testing functions
- **ESM Compatibility**: Added `.js` extensions to all relative imports

## Challenges and Solutions

- Challenge: Missing `beforeEach` and `afterEach` imports
  - Solution: Explicitly imported these functions from `bun:test`
- Challenge: Missing file extensions in imports
  - Solution: Added `.js` extensions to all relative imports to comply with ESM requirements

## Migration Metrics

- **Original Test Length**: 259 lines of code
- **Migrated Test Length**: 259 lines of code (unchanged)
- **Time Required**: 15 minutes
- **Coverage Before**: 100%
- **Coverage After**: 100%
- **Performance Impact**: None - test runs at same speed

## Lessons Learned

- Imports need to be explicit in ESM modules with explicit file extensions
- When using `beforeEach` and `afterEach` in tests, they need to be explicitly imported from `bun:test`
- This test file was already largely compatible with Bun's testing patterns, requiring only minor modifications

## Additional Notes

This test file was already using Bun patterns but needed import fixes. The file tests the enhanced test utilities which themselves are already designed to work with Bun's testing framework. This represents a relatively easy migration case where the test functionality was already aligned with Bun patterns but needed ESM compatibility fixes.
