# Test Migration Template

## File Information
- **File Path**: `/path/to/test/file.test.ts`
- **Migration Difficulty**: Easy/Medium/Hard
- **Mocking Complexity**: Low/Medium/High
- **Test Type**: Unit/Integration/E2E

## Before & After Analysis

### Code Comparison
```typescript
// BEFORE MIGRATION
// Original test code with Jest/Vitest patterns

// AFTER MIGRATION
// Migrated test code with Bun patterns
```

### Key Changes
- Replaced `jest.fn()` with `mock()`
- Updated module mocking approach
- Leveraged dependency injection
- Added improved type safety
- Used centralized test utilities

## Migration Patterns Used
- Direct replacements (list specific pattern transformations)
- Structural improvements (describe refactoring changes)
- Additional utilities created (if any new utilities were needed)
