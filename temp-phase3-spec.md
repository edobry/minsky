# Phase 3: Enhanced Planning/Execution Separation with Checkpointing

Implement sophisticated planning vs execution separation in Minsky, enabling fractal planning/execution/review cycles with AI-assisted planning, execution checkpointing, and multi-level workflow orchestration.

## Parent Task

This is Phase 3 of Task #237: Implement Hierarchical Task System with Subtasks and Dependencies

## Dependencies

- Task #238: Phase 1: Implement Basic Subtask Support with Parent-Child Relationships
- Task #239: Phase 2: Implement Task Dependencies and Basic Task Graphs

## Objectives

1. **Planning vs Execution Separation**: Distinguish between planning activities and execution activities
2. **Execution Checkpointing**: Save and restore execution state at granular levels
3. **Fractal Planning**: Support planning at multiple hierarchical levels
4. **AI-Assisted Planning**: Leverage AI for intelligent planning workflows
5. **Session Integration**: Enhanced session management for planning vs execution workflows

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Extended Task Categories

```typescript
enum TaskType {
  PLANNING = "planning", // Planning and design tasks
  EXECUTION = "execution", // Implementation and execution tasks
  REVIEW = "review", // Review and validation tasks
  RESEARCH = "research", // Investigation and learning tasks
  COORDINATION = "coordination", // Communication and coordination tasks
}

interface TaskData {
  // ... existing fields from Phases 1 & 2
  taskType: TaskType;
  planningState?: {
    isPlanned: boolean;
    planningSession?: string;
    planningNotes?: string;
    estimatedEffort?: string;
    plannedApproach?: string;
  };
  executionState?: {
    checkpoints?: ExecutionCheckpoint[];
    currentPhase?: string;
    blockers?: string[];
    actualEffort?: string;
  };
  reviewState?: {
    reviewSessions?: string[];
    reviewNotes?: string[];
    approvalStatus?: "pending" | "approved" | "needs_revision";
  };
}

interface ExecutionCheckpoint {
  id: string;
  timestamp: string;
  description: string;
  state: Record<string, any>;
  sessionId?: string;
  nextSteps?: string[];
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Session Management

- **Planning Sessions**: Dedicated sessions for planning activities
- **Execution Sessions**: Focused sessions for implementation work
- **Review Sessions**: Specialized sessions for review and feedback
- **Session Transitions**: Smooth transitions between planning and execution phases

### 3. Advanced CLI Commands

```bash
# Planning workflow
minsky tasks plan <task-id>                    # Enter planning mode for task
minsky tasks planning-session start <task-id>  # Start dedicated planning session
minsky tasks analyze-complexity <task-id>      # AI complexity analysis
minsky tasks generate-plan <task-id>           # AI-generated execution plan

# Execution checkpointing
minsky tasks checkpoint create [--description "checkpoint description"]
minsky tasks checkpoint list [--task-id <id>]
minsky tasks checkpoint restore <checkpoint-id>
minsky tasks checkpoint compare <checkpoint-1> <checkpoint-2>

# Multi-level planning
minsky tasks plan-hierarchy <root-task-id>     # Plan entire task hierarchy
minsky tasks plan-next-level <task-id>         # Plan next level of breakdown
minsky tasks validate-plan <task-id>           # AI validation of execution plan

# Review workflow
minsky tasks review start <task-id>            # Start review session
minsky tasks review checklist <task-id>        # Generate AI review checklist
minsky tasks review approve <task-id>          # Approve task completion
```

### 4. AI-Enhanced Planning

- **Planning Assistant**: AI helps break down complex tasks into actionable steps
- **Effort Estimation**: AI-powered effort estimation with confidence intervals
- **Risk Assessment**: AI identifies potential risks and mitigation strategies
- **Plan Validation**: AI reviews and validates planning completeness
- **Adaptive Planning**: AI suggests plan adjustments based on execution progress

### 5. Checkpointing System

- **State Capture**: Save execution state at meaningful checkpoints
- **Progress Tracking**: Track execution progress against planned milestones
- **Rollback Capability**: Ability to revert to previous checkpoints
- **State Comparison**: Compare execution state between checkpoints
- **Automated Checkpoints**: Automatically create checkpoints at key workflow events
