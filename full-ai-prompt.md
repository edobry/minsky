</available_instructions>

<required_instructions>
The following rules should always be followed.

bun_over_node
Always use `bun` instead of `node` when running JavaScript/TypeScript in the Synthase project. Bun is the preferred runtime for Synthase.

Examples:
- Use `bun install` instead of `npm install`
- Use `bun run` instead of `node`
- Use `bun test` instead of `jest` or `mocha`
- Use `bun build` instead of other build tools

When writing documentation, commands, or implementation code, always prefer Bun's API and CLI over Node.js equivalents. The project is specifically designed to leverage Bun's performance and capabilities.

In package.json scripts, ensure all commands use bun:
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "bun run src/index.ts",
  "dev": "bun --watch src/index.ts",
  "build": "bun build src/index.ts --outdir dist",
  "test": "bun test"
}
```

When creating new files, use the bun shebang:
```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env bun
```

This rule applies to all code, documentation, and configuration files in the Synthase project.

changelog
# Changelog Rule

## Rule Name: changelog

## Description

For any code change, **record it in the `CHANGELOG.md` file in the nearest ancestor directory that contains a `CHANGELOG.md`**.

- If the file you changed is in a subdirectory with its own `CHANGELOG.md`, use that changelog.
- If there is no `CHANGELOG.md` in the current or any parent directory, use the root `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Never update more than one changelog for a single change. Always use the most specific (deepest) changelog file in the directory tree.

### SpecStory Conversation History Referencing (Required)
- For every changegroup (e.g., Added, Changed, Fixed) in the changelog, **add a reference to the relevant SpecStory conversation history file(s) where the change originated**.
- Place the reference(s) at the end of each changegroup, using the format:
  
  `_See: SpecStory history [YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-topic](.specstory/history/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-topic.md) for ..._`
- If multiple changegroups originate from different conversations, reference each appropriately.
- At the top of the changelog, add a note referencing `.specstory/.what-is-this.md` to explain the SpecStory artifact system.

#### Example

```markdown
# Changelog

> **Note:** This changelog references SpecStory conversation histories. See [.specstory/.what-is-this.md](.specstory/.what-is-this.md) for details on the SpecStory artifact system.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- New feature X
- New feature Y

_See: SpecStory history [2025-04-26_20-30-setting-up-minsky-cli-with-bun](.specstory/history/2025-04-26_20-30-setting-up-minsky-cli-with-bun.md) for project setup._

### Changed
- Improved logic for Z

_See: SpecStory history [2025-04-26_22-29-task-management-command-design](.specstory/history/2025-04-26_22-29-task-management-command-design.md) for task management._
```

## Additional Guidance
- Only update the `CHANGELOG.md` at the end of an editing session, after testing whether the change worked.
- If a change affects multiple directories with their own changelogs, split the changelog entries accordingly, but never duplicate the same entry in multiple changelogs.
- For documentation-only changes, use the root changelog unless the documentation is scoped to a subproject with its own changelog.

## Rationale
This ensures that changelog entries are always relevant to the part of the codebase they affect, and provides traceability and context by linking to the exact SpecStory conversation(s) where the change was discussed and implemented.

### Examples

| File Changed                              | Changelog to Update         |
|----|----|
| `synthase/src/commands/tools/constants.ts`| `synthase/CHANGELOG.md`    |
| `synthase/src/utils/tools.ts`             | `synthase/CHANGELOG.md`    |
| `README.md` (root)                        | `CHANGELOG.md`             |
| `docs/usage.md`                           | `CHANGELOG.md`             |

constants-management
# Constants Management

Extract and organize constants systematically to improve maintainability and reduce duplication:

## Key Principles

1. **Extract Repetition Aggressively**: Always extract strings/characters/emoji/numbers that appear 3 or more times, even as a substring of longer strings:
   ```typescript
   // AVOID - Repeated emoji
   console.log("üî¥ Error: Connection failed");
   console.log("üî¥ Error: Authentication failed");
   console.log("üî¥ Error: Network timeout");
   
   // PREFER - Extracted emoji constant
   const ERROR_EMOJI = "üî¥";
   console.log(`${ERROR_EMOJI} Error: Connection failed`);
   console.log(`${ERROR_EMOJI} Error: Authentication failed`);
   console.log(`${ERROR_EMOJI} Error: Network timeout`);
   ```

2. **Categorize Constants**: Group related constants together in meaningful categories:
   ```typescript
   // Organize by domain
   export const BREW_CMD = {
     LIST_FORMULAS: 'brew list --formula',
     LIST_CASKS: 'brew list --cask',
     INSTALL_FORMULA: 'brew install',
     INSTALL_CASK: 'brew install --cask',
   };
   
   export const DISPLAY = {
     EMOJIS: {
       ENABLED: 'üü¢',
       DISABLED: 'üî¥',
       WARNING: '‚ö†Ô∏è',
       UNKNOWN: '‚ùì',
       CHECK: '‚úÖ',
       INSTALL: 'üèóÔ∏è',
       ADDITIONAL_INFO: '‚ÑπÔ∏è',
     },
     SEPARATOR: '‚îÄ'.repeat(80),
   };
   ```

3. **Extract Common Patterns**: Even substrings that appear in different contexts should be extracted if repeated:
   ```typescript
   // AVOID
   app.get('/api/users', ...);
   app.post('/api/users', ...);
   app.get('/api/posts', ...);
   
   // PREFER
   const API_PREFIX = '/api';
   app.get(`${API_PREFIX}/users`, ...);
   app.post(`${API_PREFIX}/users`, ...);
   app.get(`${API_PREFIX}/posts`, ...);
   ```

4. **Consolidate Related Files**: Keep all constants in one place or organized by domain:
   ```typescript
   // constants/index.ts - The main export point
   export * from './display';
   export * from './commands';
   export * from './paths';
   
   // constants/display.ts - Display-related constants
   export const DISPLAY = { ... };
   
   // constants/commands.ts - Command-related constants
   export const COMMANDS = { ... };
   ```

5. **Use Template Literals For Derived Constants**: Derive constants from other constants when possible:
   ```typescript
   const BASE_URL = 'https://api.example.com';
   const API_VERSION = 'v1';
   
   // Derived constant using template literals
   const API_ENDPOINT = `${BASE_URL}/${API_VERSION}`;
   ```

6. **Proper Types for Constants**: Use proper TypeScript types for constants:
   ```typescript
   // String literal union for status
   export type Status = 'idle' | 'loading' | 'success' | 'error';
   
   // Properly typed object of constants
   export const HTTP_STATUS: Record<string, number> = {
     OK: 200,
     CREATED: 201,
     BAD_REQUEST: 400,
     UNAUTHORIZED: 401,
     FORBIDDEN: 403,
     NOT_FOUND: 404,
     SERVER_ERROR: 500,
   };
   ```

7. **Environment-specific Constants**: Handle environment-specific constants cleanly:
   ```typescript
   // Base constants for all environments
   const BASE_CONSTANTS = {
     TIMEOUT_MS: 5000,
     MAX_RETRIES: 3,
   };
   
   // Environment-specific overrides
   const ENV_CONSTANTS = {
     development: {
       ...BASE_CONSTANTS,
       API_URL: 'http://localhost:3000',
       TIMEOUT_MS: 10000, // Longer timeout for development
     },
     production: {
       ...BASE_CONSTANTS,
       API_URL: 'https://api.example.com',
     },
   };
   
   // Export the appropriate constants
   export const CONSTANTS = ENV_CONSTANTS[process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'];
   ```

## Benefits

- **Reduced Duplication**: Constants are defined once and reused
- **Easier Updates**: Changing a constant value in one place updates it everywhere
- **Better Readability**: Meaningful constant names improve code clarity
- **Type Safety**: Constants can be properly typed with TypeScript
- **Centralized Configuration**: Application configuration is managed in one place

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

- **Magic Strings/Numbers**: Avoid hardcoded strings or numbers scattered throughout the code
- **Duplicated Constants**: Don't define the same constant in multiple places
- **Meaningless Constant Names**: Use descriptive names that convey the purpose and meaning
- **Mixing Constants with Logic**: Keep constants separate from the logic that uses them
- **Constants Sprawl**: Don't create too many small constant files; organize them logically
- **Missed Repetition**: Don't miss opportunities to extract strings that repeat 3+ times

domain-oriented-modules
# Domain-Oriented Module Organization

When organizing code in a modular application, follow these principles for better maintainability:

## Principles

- **Reduce cross-module dependencies and import cycles**
  - Co-locate related functions to prevent circular imports
  - Move utility functions to modules where they're most relevant

- **Improve code understandability**
  - Keep related functions together based on domain, not just technical category
  - Group functions by what they operate on rather than how they operate

- **Enhance maintainability**
  - Organize code according to domain boundaries, not just technical layers
  - Make it easier to update related functionality without needing to touch multiple files

- **Clarify utility purposes**
  - Make it obvious which utilities are general-purpose vs. domain-specific
  - Place domain-specific utilities in relevant command/feature modules

## Examples

### ‚ùå Avoid: Cross-Module Dependencies

```typescript
// utils/homebrew.ts
export async function isBrewPackageInstalled() { /* ... */ }

// commands/tools/homebrew.ts
import { isBrewPackageInstalled } from '../../utils/homebrew.ts';
export function getToolBrewPackageName(brewConfig, toolId) { /* ... */ }

// utils/tool-status.ts
import { getToolBrewPackageName } from '../commands/tools/homebrew';
import { isBrewPackageInstalled } from './homebrew';
```

### ‚úÖ Better: Domain-Oriented Organization

```typescript
// utils/homebrew.ts - Contains ALL homebrew-related functions
export async function isBrewPackageInstalled() { /* ... */ }
export function getToolBrewPackageName(brewConfig, toolId) { /* ... */ }
export function normalizeBrewConfig(brewConfig, toolId) { /* ... */ }

// Commands use the consolidated utility module
import { isBrewPackageInstalled, getToolBrewPackageName } from '../../utils/homebrew';
```

## Guidelines

1. **Identify Domain Boundaries**: Group code by what it operates on (tools, fibers, config) rather than how (utils, helpers)

2. **Co-locate Related Functions**: Functions that work with the same data or concept should be in the same file

3. **Minimize Cross-Layer Dependencies**: Avoid having utils depend on commands and vice versa

4. **Consolidate Shared Interfaces**: Keep type definitions together with their primary implementation

5. **Merge Fragmented Utilities**: If multiple utility files serve the same domain, consider merging them

dont-ignore-errors
ANY errors encountered during implementation, testing, or verification MUST be fixed before considering the task complete, regardless of whether they appear related to your current changes. This includes warnings, linting errors, type errors, and build errors.

If you encounter errors that seem to require significant changes beyond the original scope:
1. Explicitly acknowledge all errors 
2. Propose a plan to fix them
3. Ask for confirmation before proceeding with the fixes
4. Never mark a task as complete while known errors remain

Violations of this rule are considered implementation failures.

When you run into errors, make sure to explicitly mention what you're doing and record the context of the change you're making prior to switching over to working on the error.

file-size
Try to not create very large code files, the definition of which is flexible but generally not more than ~500 lines, ideally much less. Don't break them up arbitrarily but look for opportunities to extract submodules/utility modules along subdomain lines.

module-organization
# Module Organization

Business logic should be strictly separated from CLI concerns.

## Domain Modules
- All business logic should live in `src/domain/` modules
- Domain modules should be focused on a single domain concept
- Example: `src/domain/git.ts` for git-related business logic

## Command Modules
Command modules should only handle:
- Parsing command-line arguments and options
- Setting up the environment
- Calling domain modules
- Formatting and displaying output
- Error handling and exit codes

Example: `src/commands/git/clone.ts` should only handle CLI concerns while delegating actual git operations to `src/domain/git.ts`

robust-error-handling
# Robust Error Handling

Always implement thorough error handling that provides clear, actionable information:

## Key Principles

1. **Type-safe Error Handling**: Ensure errors maintain their proper types to preserve stack traces and error details:
   ```typescript
   // AVOID
   catch (err) {
     console.error(`Error: ${err}`); // Converts Error object to string, losing the stack trace
   }

   // PREFER
   catch (err) {
     const error = err instanceof Error ? err : new Error(String(err));
     console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
     // log error.stack when needed
   }
   ```

2. **Structured Error Objects**: Use structured error objects rather than error strings:
   ```typescript
   // For function results that may contain errors
   interface OperationResult {
     success: boolean;
     error?: Error;
     message?: string;
   }

   // For specialized error types
   class ConfigurationError extends Error {
     constructor(message: string) {
       super(message);
       this.name = 'ConfigurationError';
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Graceful Degradation**: Always handle errors in a way that allows the application to continue running if possible:
   ```typescript
   async function checkStatus() {
     try {
       // Core functionality
     } catch (err) {
       logger.error(`Status check failed: ${err instanceof Error ? err.message : String(err)}`);
       // Return a default or fallback state
       return { status: 'unknown', error: err };
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Propagate Relevant Context**: Include context information with errors:
   ```typescript
   try {
     await processFile(filePath);
   } catch (err) {
     throw new Error(`Failed to process file ${filePath}: ${err.message}`, { cause: err });
   }
   ```

5. **Timeouts for Async Operations**: Always include timeouts for operations that might hang:
   ```typescript
   // Set up a timeout with proper cleanup
   const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => {
     const id = setTimeout(() => {
       clearTimeout(id);
       reject(new Error(`Operation timed out after ${timeoutMs}ms`));
     }, timeoutMs);
   });

   // Race the operation against the timeout
   return Promise.race([operation(), timeoutPromise]);
   ```

6. **Cleanup Resources**: Ensure resources are cleaned up even when errors occur:
   ```typescript
   let resource;
   try {
     resource = acquireResource();
     return useResource(resource);
   } finally {
     if (resource) {
       releaseResource(resource);
     }
   }
   ```

## Benefits

- **Better Debuggability**: Preserved stack traces and error contexts make debugging easier
- **Improved Stability**: The application can continue running despite non-critical failures
- **Clearer Error Messages**: Users and developers get actionable information
- **Resource Safety**: Prevents resource leaks in error scenarios

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

- **Swallowing Errors Silently**: Never catch errors without proper handling or logging
- **String Concatenation for Error Messages**: Avoid using + for error messages, use template literals
- **Generic Error Messages**: Error messages should be specific about what failed and why
- **Untyped Error Handling**: Always handle the fact that errors might not be Error instances

self-improvement-router
# Self-Improvement Router

Scan every user message for signals of dissatisfaction, error, or correction (e.g., user says "that's wrong", "you're doing it again", "fix this", or expresses frustration).

- If any such signal is detected, immediately invoke the self-improvement rule before any other action.
- Do not proceed with any other workflow until the self-improvement protocol is completed.
- Do not attach the full self-improvement rule unless triggered by this router rule.

// AVOID
Proceeding with normal workflow after user signals error or dissatisfaction.

// PREFER
Pause, invoke self-improvement rule, communicate analysis, then proceed.

template-literals
When constructing strings in TypeScript, especially when doing concatenation/substitution, tend towards using template literals liberally.

test-expectations
# Test Expectations Management

When making code changes that will modify behavior and require updating test expectations:

1. **Test-First Modification**: Always modify tests to reflect the expected new behavior *before* implementing the actual code change.

2. **Explicit Expectation Updates**: When test expectations need to change, comment the changes with explicit reasoning:
   ```typescript
   // Updating test expectation: now using BLACK_CIRCLE (‚ö´) for disabled status 
   // instead of RED_CIRCLE (üî¥) per design decision in PR #123
   expect(getChainStatus(false, true)).toBe('‚ö´');
   ```

3. **Snapshot Updates**: For snapshot tests, run tests with `--update-snapshots` flag only *after* you understand and validate the expected changes.

4. **Regression Prevention**: Include both the old and new expected values in your commit message to document the intentional change:
   ```
   feat: Change disabled status indicator from üî¥ to ‚ö´
   
   - Updates getChainStatus to use BLACK_CIRCLE for disabled items
   - Updates tests that previously expected RED_CIRCLE (üî¥) to now expect BLACK_CIRCLE (‚ö´)
   ```

5. **Review Test Changes First**: When reviewing PRs, always examine test expectation changes before implementation changes to understand the intent.

This practice ensures test changes are deliberate rather than reflexive adjustments to make failing tests pass, maintaining the tests' value as specifications of intended behavior.

tests
Rule Name: tests
Description: 
Test Coverage and Quality Requirements:

1. **When to Run Tests**
   - Run tests after ANY change to:
     - Source code files (*.ts, *.js)
     - Test files (*.test.ts, *.spec.ts)
     - Configuration files that affect test behavior
   - Do NOT run tests for:
     - Documentation changes (*.md)
     - Comment-only changes
     - Formatting-only changes (unless they affect test output)

2. **Which Tests to Run**
   - Run all tests in the affected package/module
   - For changes to shared utilities or core functionality, run all tests
   - Use `bun test` for the default test suite
   - Use `bun test --coverage` when making significant changes

3. **Test Success Criteria**
   - All tests must pass (no failures)
   - No new test warnings should be introduced
   - Test coverage should not decrease for modified files
   - Flaky tests should be fixed or marked as such

4. **Test Development**
   - When writing new tests:
     - Only the new/modified test files should be failing
     - Document why tests are failing in the commit message
     - Fix failing tests before completing the change
   - When modifying existing tests:
     - Ensure changes maintain or improve test coverage
     - Update test documentation if behavior changes
     - Consider adding new tests for edge cases

5. **Test Environment**
   - Run tests in the development environment
   - Ensure all required dependencies are installed
   - Document any environment-specific requirements

6. **Test Reporting**
   - Document any skipped tests and why
   - Note any changes to test coverage
   - Flag any new test warnings or flaky tests

7. **Test Integrity Requirements**
   - **ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN:**
     - Creating placeholder/mock tests to bypass failures
     - Commenting out failing tests instead of fixing them
     - Using `test.skip()` or similar to avoid test failures
     - Any practice that hides or ignores test failures
   - All test failures MUST be properly addressed by either:
     - Fixing the underlying code issue
     - Updating test expectations with proper justification
     - Refactoring the test to properly test the intended behavior
   - If a test is failing:
     - Document the failure in detail
     - Create a plan to fix it
     - Get approval for the fix approach
     - Implement the fix
     - Verify the fix with proper test coverage
   - Never merge code with:
     - Failing tests
     - Placeholder tests
     - Skipped tests without documented justification
     - Mock tests that don't actually test functionality

This is a zero-tolerance policy. Any violation will require immediate remediation.

user-preferences
# User Preferences

This rule documents preferences expressed by the user during interactions with the AI coding assistant. These preferences are to be adhered to in future interactions.

## MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM

**This rule MUST be actively enforced before generating any response:**

```
// BEFORE GENERATING ANY RESPONSE, EVALUATE:
if (response contains confirmation question && next step is obvious)
  -> BLOCK response, remove question, proceed with implied action
if (response contains "Would you like me to...")
  -> BLOCK response, replace with direct action statement
if (response explains what will be done next without doing it)
  -> BLOCK response, replace with actual implementation
```

The above is not optional guidance - it is a mandatory filter that must be applied to every response before it is sent.

## Workflow Preferences

- **Avoid unnecessary confirmation prompts:** Do not ask for confirmation on obvious next steps in the workflow. If the next step is clearly implied by the conversation, proceed without asking for confirmation.
- **Never ask clarifying questions if the next steps seem obvious:** If the next steps are clearly implied by the conversation, proceed without asking for confirmation. The AI should make reasonable assumptions about the user's intent and proceed accordingly.
- **Prefer direct action over explanation:** When the user's intent is clear, take the action rather than explaining what you will do.
- **Document new preferences:** Add any new user preferences to this rule as they arise in future sessions.
- **Never ask for confirmation on next steps like 'Would you like to proceed with ...?'.**
- **Always execute the next logical step when the user says 'do it, don't just tell me what to do', or similar.**
- **If a test or command fails or hangs, attempt to debug and resolve it automatically, rather than asking the user what to do next.**
- **When a workflow or troubleshooting step is implied, proceed with it directly.**
- **Balance proactiveness with task interpretation:** When the user asks to "create a task", always create a task specification document first. Only proceed to implementation if explicitly directed to do so.
- **Default to specification over implementation:** When in doubt about whether the user wants a task specified or implemented, default to creating a specification document unless they've explicitly asked for implementation.
- **When the user says to keep going or not to ask for confirmation/status, proceed through all actionable issues without pausing, and only stop when all are resolved or all tests pass.**

## VERIFICATION CHECKPOINT

At the end of drafting ANY response, the AI must verify:
1. Does this response contain ANY confirmation questions? If yes, remove them.
2. Does this response explain actions without taking them? If yes, replace with the actual implementation.
3. Does this response ask "Would you like me to..." when the intent is clear? If yes, rewrite to take direct action.
4. **If the user has stated a preference for uninterrupted progress, never pause for confirmation or status unless explicitly requested.**

> **AI Commitment:** The AI will always strictly adhere to these preferences, especially regarding avoiding confirmation prompts and always taking the next implied step without asking. This is a persistent, high-priority rule for all future interactions.

## Operating Environment and Initialization

```
You are a powerful agentic AI coding assistant, powered by Claude 3.7 Sonnet. You operate exclusively in Cursor, the world's best IDE.

Your main goal is to follow the USER's instructions at each message.

# Additional context
Each time the USER sends a message, we may automatically attach some information about their current state, such as what files they have open, where their cursor is, recently viewed files, edit history in their session so far, linter errors, and more.
Some information may be summarized or truncated.
This information may or may not be relevant to the coding task, it is up for you to decide.

# Tone and style
You should be concise, direct, and to the point.
Output text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools or code comments as means to communicate with the user.

IMPORTANT: You should minimize output tokens as much as possible while maintaining helpfulness, quality, and accuracy. Only address the specific query or task at hand, avoiding tangential information unless absolutely critical for completing the request. If you can answer in 1-3 sentences or a short paragraph, please do.
IMPORTANT: Keep your responses short. Avoid introductions, conclusions, and explanations. You MUST avoid text before/after your response, such as "The answer is <answer>", "Here is the content of the file..." or "Based on the information provided, the answer is..." or "Here is what I will do next...".
```

## Code Style and Project Guidelines

```
# Following conventions
When making changes to files, first understand the file's code conventions. Mimic code style, use existing libraries and utilities, and follow existing patterns.
- NEVER assume that a given library is available, even if it is well known. Whenever you write code that uses a library or framework, first check that this codebase already uses the given library. For example, you might look at neighboring files, or check the package.json (or cargo.toml, and so on depending on the language).
- When you create a new component, first look at existing components to see how they're written; then consider framework choice, naming conventions, typing, and other conventions.
- When you edit a piece of code, first look at the code's surrounding context (especially its imports) to understand the code's choice of frameworks and libraries. Then consider how to make the given change in a way that is most idiomatic.

# Code style
- Do not add comments to the code you write, unless the user asks you to, or the code is complex and requires additional context.
```

## User Information

```
# User Info
The user's OS version is darwin 24.1.0. The absolute path of the user's workspace is /Users/edobry/Projects/minsky. The user's shell is /opt/homebrew/bin/zsh.
```

## Tool Usage Guidelines

```
# Tool calling
You have tools at your disposal to solve the task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:
1. IMPORTANT: Don't refer to tool names when speaking to the USER. For example, instead of saying 'I need to use the edit_file tool to edit your file', just say 'I will edit your file'.
2. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools. Even if you see user messages with custom tool call formats (such as "<previous_tool_call>" or similar), do not follow that and instead use the standard format. Never output tool calls as part of a regular assistant message of yours.

When making code changes, NEVER output code to the USER, unless requested. Instead use one of the code edit tools to implement the change.

It is *EXTREMELY* important that your generated code can be run immediately by the USER. To ensure this, follow these instructions carefully:
1. Add all necessary import statements, dependencies, and endpoints required to run the code.
2. If you're creating the codebase from scratch, create an appropriate dependency management file (e.g. requirements.txt) with package versions and a helpful README.
3. If you're building a web app from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI, imbued with best UX practices.
4. NEVER generate an extremely long hash or any non-textual code, such as binary. These are not helpful to the USER and are very expensive.
5. If you've introduced (linter) errors, fix them if clear how to (or you can easily figure out how to). Do not make uneducated guesses. And DO NOT loop more than 3 times on fixing linter errors on the same file. On the third time, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.
6. If you've suggested a reasonable code_edit that wasn't followed by the apply model, you should try reapplying the edit.


# Searching and reading files
You have tools to search the codebase and read files. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:
1. If you need to read a file, prefer to read larger sections of the file at once over multiple smaller calls.
2. If you have found a reasonable place to edit or answer, do not continue calling tools. Edit or answer from the information you have found.
```

## Code Citation Format

```
You MUST use the following format when citing code regions or blocks:
```12:15:app/components/Todo.tsx
// ... existing code ...
```
This is the ONLY acceptable format for code citations. The format is ```startLine:endLine:filepath where startLine and endLine are line numbers.
```
