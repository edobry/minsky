# Task 026: Fix Task Spec Paths - Completion Report

## Summary

This task involved fixing the task specification path generation to use a standardized format (`process/tasks/<id>-<kebab-case-title>.md`) and ensuring the `tasks get` command returns the correct paths. The implementation included adding comprehensive tests for the task spec path resolution logic and fixing related test failures.

## Implementation Details

1. **Task Spec Path Resolution**
   - Created comprehensive tests in `tasks.specpath.test.ts` to validate the spec path resolution logic
   - Verified that the existing implementation in `validateSpecPath()` correctly handles standardized paths
   - Ensured the function can find files with different names but correct ID prefixes
   - Added tests for edge cases like missing files, malformed paths, and multiple files with the same ID prefix

2. **Test Fixes**
   - Fixed session mocking in tests to properly handle session record retrieval
   - Fixed repository path resolution in tests to handle session contexts correctly
   - Improved mock implementations to better simulate real behavior

## Verification

All tests related to task spec path resolution are now passing. The implementation correctly:

1. Returns standardized spec paths in the format `process/tasks/<id>-<kebab-case-title>.md`
2. Handles cases where spec files exist with different names but the same ID prefix
3. Gracefully handles missing spec files and directories
4. Properly validates task IDs and paths

## Remaining Issues

There are still 13 failing tests in the codebase, primarily related to:
- Repository path resolution in `repo-utils.test.ts` (2 failures)
- GitService session handling in `git.test.ts` (2 failures)
- Session creation logic in `startSession.test.ts` (9 failures)

These failures are related to session/repo path resolution and session creation logic, which are outside the scope of this task. They will need to be addressed in a separate task.

## Conclusion

The task has been completed successfully. The task spec path generation now uses a standardized format, and comprehensive tests have been added to ensure the functionality works correctly. The changes have been committed with the message "fix: update task spec path generation to use standardized format".
