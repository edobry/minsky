# Task 022 Completion

## Progress Made

- Fixed import paths in src/cli.ts to use relative paths (./commands/session) instead of absolute paths (./src/commands/session)
- Added missing command imports in src/cli.ts (tasks, git, and init commands)
- Fixed test failures in several session command tests by correcting import paths
- Successfully fixed the tests for:
  - src/commands/tasks/list.test.ts
  - src/commands/session/cd.test.ts (when run individually)
  - src/commands/session/autodetect.test.ts (when run individually)

## Remaining Issues

1. **Session Command Tests**: When running all tests together, many session command tests still fail:
   - Session path detection tests are failing
   - Session autodetection tests are failing
   - Session get/list/delete commands are failing

2. **Update Command Tests**: The session update command tests are failing with:
   ```
   ENOENT: no such file or directory, posix_spawn '/bin/sh'
   ```
   This appears to be an environment-specific issue with running git commands in the test environment.

3. **StartSession Tests**: The startSession tests are failing with mock function call expectations not being met.

## Next Steps

1. Fix the remaining session command tests by ensuring the test environment is properly set up with the correct paths and environment variables.

2. Address the git command execution issues in the update command tests, possibly by mocking the git commands or fixing the environment setup.

3. Fix the startSession tests by ensuring the mock functions are properly called.

4. Run a complete test suite to verify all tests are passing.

## Summary

We've made significant progress in fixing the test failures by correcting import paths and ensuring the CLI commands are properly registered. However, there are still issues with the test environment setup and mock function expectations that need to be addressed to fully complete the task.
