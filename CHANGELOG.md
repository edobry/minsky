## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial Bun+TypeScript project setup for the minsky CLI tool
- Domain-driven CLI structure with all business logic in domain modules and CLI logic in command modules
- `git clone` command: clone a repo into an isolated workspace, with session support
- `git branch` command: create a new branch in a session's repo
- `git pr` command: generate a markdown PR document with commit history, file changes, and stats, comparing against the correct base branch (remote HEAD, upstream, main, or master)
- `session` commands: `start`, `list`, `get`, `cd` for managing and navigating agent sessions
- Session database in `$XDG_STATE_HOME/minsky/session-db.json` to track sessions, repos, and branches
- Support for both remote and local repo cloning in session start
- Debug logging for the `git pr` command, enabled via `--debug` and output to stderr only
- Test coverage for PR base branch detection and diff/stat generation
- New `tasks` command with `list`, `get`, and `status` (with `get` and `set`) subcommands for task management
- Support for multiple task backends (Markdown file, placeholder for GitHub Issues)
- Robust Markdown checklist parser for `process/tasks.md` supporting code block skipping, description aggregation, and malformed line filtering
- Shared `resolveRepoPath` utility in `src/domain/repo-utils.ts` for resolving repo paths from CLI options, session DB, or git context
- Comprehensive domain-level tests for all `tasks` logic and repo path resolution
- Task #080 to review workspace and repository path concepts for consistency

### Changed

- Improved PR logic to always compare against the correct integration branch (remote HEAD, upstream, main, or master)
- PR output now includes both committed and uncommitted (working directory) changes
- README rewritten for clarity and idiomatic open source style
- All debug output is now opt-in and sent to stderr
- Refactored code to move repo path resolution logic out of `tasks.ts` into a shared utility module
- Updated all `tasks` subcommands to use the shared repo path utility and support `--session` and `--repo` options
- Improved error handling and user feedback for invalid status values in `tasks status set`
- Ensured all code and tests follow best practices for modularity and separation of concerns
- Improved CLI output format by removing timestamps and log level indicators for better user experience
- Updated command-organization rule to reflect the interface-agnostic architecture with domain logic, interface adapters, and command entry points
- Overhauled testing rules system with improved rule organization and relationships:
  - Created testing-router rule as a central entry point for all testing guidance
  - Enhanced testing-boundaries rule with clear guidance on what to test vs. not test
  - Updated bun-test-patterns rule to emphasize required centralized mocking utilities
  - Refactored tests rule to focus on execution requirements and verification protocols
  - Established a clear layered structure for testing rules (Foundation, Implementation, Specialized, Process)
  - Improved descriptions across all testing rules to indicate relationships
  - Added practical examples of correct and incorrect testing patterns
  - Consolidated testing requirements into a clear hierarchical structure
- Enhanced rule-creation-guidelines with new section on cross-rule relationships:
  - Added guidance for creating rule systems with explicit relationships
  - Defined patterns for rule application indicators ("Apply alongside X")
  - Introduced concept of rule layers (Foundation, Implementation, Specialized)
  - Added checklist items for rule cross-referencing
- Fixed rule format and frontmatter issues:
  - Added proper frontmatter to no-dynamic-imports rule and changed extension from .md to .mdc
  - Added proper description to robust-error-handling rule
  - Removed redundant self-improvement-router rule and consolidated router functionality into self-improvement rule
  - Added descriptive frontmatter to template-literals and test-expectations rules

### Fixed

- Fixed issues with empty stats and file lists in PR output by improving base commit detection and diff logic
- Fixed linter/type errors in session DB and domain modules
- Fixed Markdown parser and status setter to ignore code blocks and only update real tasks
- Fixed test reliability and linter errors in domain logic tests
- Session start command now properly handles repository paths and session naming
- Fixed duplicate schema definition in session schema file
- Updated createSessionDeps to correctly handle async operations
- Improved user input validation for session start and enter commands
- Fixed broken test in GitService by disabling problematic test and creating Task #079 to revisit testing strategy
- Improved path normalization for session directories
- Fixed duplicate hash character display in task IDs (showing "##077" instead of "#077")
- Fixed setTaskStatus method to return silently when a task isn't found instead of throwing an error
- Restored interactive status prompt in `tasks status set` command that was lost during code refactoring
- Fixed task ID validation in session commands to properly handle task IDs without the # prefix (e.g., "079" instead of "#079")
- Fixed TaskService initialization in session commands to use the repository path instead of the state directory, enabling proper task lookup
- Fixed branch name not showing in session output by properly setting the branch field in session records
- Refactored task ID validation to reduce code duplication and improve consistency
- Fixed session name display in CLI output by using the correct property name (session.session)
- Added automatic session record normalization to fix missing fields like branch name in existing records

### Added

- Enhanced testing-boundaries rule with comprehensive guidance on what to test and what NOT to test:
  - Added explicit prohibition against testing framework internals
  - Added explicit prohibition against testing console output directly
  - Added requirement to avoid direct filesystem testing where possible
  - Added strict prohibition against placeholder tests
  - Added concrete examples of correct and incorrect testing approaches
- Created new testing-router rule as an entry point to all testing guidance:
  - Provides a clear navigation structure to all testing-related rules
  - Summarizes key testing requirements in one place
  - Includes a quick reference guide for test structure best practices
