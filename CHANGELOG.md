## test(md#414): refactor ConfigWriter tests to Bun mockImplementation pattern; strict qualified task IDs in session tests

- Converted `src/domain/configuration/config-writer.test.ts` to use individual Bun `mock().mockImplementation(...)` mocks and `spyOn` bindings; no grouped holder reassignments. Tests pass and avoid real fs.
- Updated session-related tests to enforce strict qualified task IDs (`md#265`, `md#123`, `md#160`).
- Reduced failing tests to 14; next focus is interface-agnostic task functions and multi-backend service tests.
