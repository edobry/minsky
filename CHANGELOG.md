## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Task #025: Added git approve command for session PR merging
  - Added `git approve` command to merge PR branches into the base branch
  - Implemented task metadata storage with merge commit information
  - Added clean exit codes for error conditions (dirty work tree, merge conflicts, etc.)
  - Enhanced GitService with PR branch management functionality
  - Integrated with task metadata to record merge information

_See: SpecStory history [2025-05-18_git-approve-command](.specstory/history/2025-05-18_git-approve-command.md) for git approve command implementation._

- Task #078: Fixed rules CLI to operate on rules in the current workspace (main or session)

  - Modified resolveWorkspacePath function to use the current directory instead of main workspace when in a session
  - Updated tests to validate the new behavior
  - This allows the rules CLI (list, get, create, update, etc.) to properly operate on rules in session workspaces

- Added workspace verification best practices as part of Task #078:

  - **Workspace Verification Protocol**: Always verify current directory with pwd/ls, confirm branch with git status, and check directory structure
  - **Command Verification Protocol**: Check command availability with --help, verify syntax, handle errors properly
  - **Error Handling Protocol**: Address all linter errors, fix straightforward ones, document complex issues
  - These practices help prevent accidental changes to main workspace and reduce errors from incorrect command usage

- Task #082 to add context management commands for environment-agnostic AI collaboration, enabling context portability between different AI agents, analyzing and optimizing prompt context, simulating rule loading, and providing model awareness

_See: SpecStory history [2025-05-16_context-management-commands](.specstory/history/2025-05-16_context-management-commands.md) for context management commands._

- Initial Bun+TypeScript project setup for the minsky CLI tool
- Domain-driven CLI structure with all business logic in domain modules and CLI logic in command modules
- `git clone` command: clone a repo into an isolated workspace, with session support
- `git branch` command: create a new branch in a session's repo
- `git pr` command: generate a markdown PR document with commit history, file changes, and stats, comparing against the correct base branch (remote HEAD, upstream, main, or master)
- `session` commands: `start`, `list`, `get`, `cd` for managing and navigating agent sessions
- Session database in `$XDG_STATE_HOME/minsky/session-db.json` to track sessions, repos, and branches

- Test coverage for PR base branch detection and diff/stat generation
- New `tasks` command with `list`, `get`, and `status` (with `get` and `set`) subcommands for task management
- Support for multiple task backends (Markdown file, placeholder for GitHub Issues)
- Robust Markdown checklist parser for `process/tasks.md` supporting code block skipping, description aggregation, and malformed line filtering
- Shared `resolveRepoPath` utility in `src/domain/repo-utils.ts` for resolving repo paths from CLI options, session DB, or git context
- Comprehensive domain-level tests for all `tasks` logic and repo path resolution
- Task #080 to review workspace and repository path concepts for consistency
- Enhanced PR workflow with a streamlined approach to creating and merging pull requests:
  - Renamed `git pr` to `git summary` to maintain original PR description functionality
  - Added `git prepare-pr` for creating PR branches with prepared merge commits
  - Added `git merge-pr` for merging PR branches via fast-forward
  - Added `session approve` for integrating PR merging with task status updates

### Changed

- Improved PR logic to always compare against the correct integration branch (remote HEAD, upstream, main, or master)
- PR output now includes both committed and uncommitted (working directory) changes
- README rewritten for clarity and idiomatic open source style
- All debug output is now opt-in and sent to stderr

  - Documentation updated to clarify how to enable debug logging when needed
- Refactored code to move repo path resolution logic out of `tasks.ts` into a shared utility module

- Ensured all code and tests follow best practices for modularity and separation of concerns
- Improved CLI output format by removing timestamps and log level indicators for better user experience
- Updated command-organization rule to reflect the interface-agnostic architecture with domain logic, interface adapters, and command entry points
- **Breaking Change**: Removed the original `git pr` command, replacing it with `git summary` with identical functionality
- Overhauled testing rules system with improved rule organization and relationships:
  - Created testing-router rule as a central entry point for all testing guidance
  - Enhanced testing-boundaries rule with clear guidance on what to test vs. not test
  - Updated bun-test-patterns rule to emphasize required centralized mocking utilities
  - Refactored tests rule to focus on execution requirements and verification protocols
  - Established a clear layered structure for testing rules (Foundation, Implementation, Specialized, Process)
  - Improved descriptions across all testing rules to indicate relationships
  - Added practical examples of correct and incorrect testing patterns
  - Consolidated testing requirements into a clear hierarchical structure
- Enhanced rule-creation-guidelines with new section on cross-rule relationships:
  - Added guidance for creating rule systems with explicit relationships
  - Defined patterns for rule application indicators ("Apply alongside X")
  - Introduced concept of rule layers (Foundation, Implementation, Specialized)
  - Added checklist items for rule cross-referencing
- Fixed rule format and frontmatter issues:
  - Added proper frontmatter to no-dynamic-imports rule and changed extension from .md to .mdc
  - Added proper description to robust-error-handling rule
  - Removed redundant self-improvement-router rule and consolidated router functionality into self-improvement rule
  - Added descriptive frontmatter to template-literals and test-expectations rules
