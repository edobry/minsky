### Fixed

- **Task Edit and Create CLI Feedback (mt#501)**: Improved user feedback for task modification commands

  - Added explicit success messages with ✅ checkmarks for successful operations
  - Added explicit failure messages with ❌ crosses for failed operations
  - Fixed `tasks create --spec-path` to actually read and save specification content in a single operation
  - Enhanced error messages with actionable tips and suggestions
  - Added proper exit codes (0 for success, non-zero for failure)
  - Improved success confirmations showing what was changed (old vs new values)

- logger imports: Normalized all logger imports to the canonical `src/utils/logger` module and corrected relative
  import paths across domain/adapters. Removed `.js` extensions where necessary to align with project import
  conventions. Fixed malformed import blocks discovered during normalization.

- rules operations filesystem DI: Injected filesystem dependencies into modular rule operations and refactored
  `file-operations` to use injected `fsPromises`/`existsSyncFn` instead of direct imports. Improves testability and
  eliminated remaining readdir-related test failures.

- test: Fix hybrid template helper generating MCP syntax with preferMcp=false

  - Updated `template-system.test.ts` mock to prefer CLI for hybrid when `preferMcp` is false
  - Adjusted session context resolution test to align expected session with `TEST_PATHS.MINSKY_SESSIONS_TASK`
  - Result: test suite now runs 1571 tests with 0 failures

- **Session merge logging**: Improved human-friendliness by removing implementation detail noise

  - Removed 'handled by task backend' parenthetical from task status updates
  - Removed 'using github backend for merge' implementation detail
  - Removed 'Starting session merge...' noise padding for operations that speak for themselves
  - Removed 'Session PR merged successfully!' message redundant with merge action
  - Removed 'Session record removed from database' internal cleanup detail
  - Removed final generic 'Success' message by setting printed=true flag
  - Removed 'Cleaning up local branches...' noise padding for fast operations
  - Output now focuses on actionable information: PR approval status, merge commit hash, and meaningful cleanup counts

- tasks delete: Make deletion resilient across backends when primary routed backend cannot delete
  - Added fallback in `TaskServiceImpl.deleteTask` to attempt deletion on other registered backends when the routed backend returns false or is unavailable
  - Resolves failures like `Failed to delete task mt#464` when DB-backed tasks exist but routing or registration prevents direct deletion
  - Verified via CLI: `minsky tasks delete --force --json mt#464` now returns success and the task is removed from listings
- **Test Architecture**: Replaced global state reset anti-pattern with isolated per-test resources in configuration tests
  - Removed `resetGlobalConfiguration` function that shared state between tests
  - Replaced global configuration functions with isolated provider instances per test
  - Create new configuration factory and provider for each test ensuring true test independence
  - Tests now use completely isolated resources and can run safely in parallel
  - Follow proper dependency injection patterns for test isolation
- tasks search: Replace obsolete createTaskServiceWithDatabase with createConfiguredTaskService to fix CLI runtime error in `minsky tasks search` and `tasks similar`. Restored default `tasks.backend=markdown`. Removed lexical fallback so embeddings search returns true zero-result when embeddings are unavailable or mismatched, avoiding masking indexing/config issues.
- Replaced defensive checks with proper dependency injection for file system operations in rules helpers
  - Refactored `readContentFromFileIfExists` to accept file system dependencies using established DI pattern
  - Updated callers in `rules.ts` to provide FS dependencies following `RuleService` pattern
  - Resolved test failures caused by module loading issues during full test suite runs
  - Improved consistency with existing codebase dependency injection architecture
- Fixed SASL_SIGNATURE_MISMATCH database authentication error when using `minsky tasks list` command. The minsky task backend now properly uses the configured PostgreSQL connection string from `sessiondb.postgres.connectionString` instead of a hardcoded connection string with outdated credentials.

- **CRITICAL Security**: Enhanced secret scanning to detect database credentials - gitleaks now catches PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis connection strings with credentials (closes major security gap that allowed Supabase credentials to slip through)
- Silenced Import Extension Fixer verbose output when `AGENT=1` environment variable is set
  - Eliminates 30+ repetitive "Import Extension Fixer Report" messages during test runs
  - Only shows errors in quiet mode for actionable feedback
  - Dramatically reduces test output noise in pre-commit hooks and CI environments
  - Maintains full functionality while respecting quiet mode preferences
- **Security**: Remove hardcoded PostgreSQL URL fallback in storage configuration - now properly throws error when MINSKY_POSTGRES_URL not set, preventing accidental connections to unintended databases
- Fix bug in rules search where `rule.spec.toLowerCase()` should be `rule.description.toLowerCase()` causing search failures with undefined property access
- Add CLI customization for `rules search` to accept query as positional argument, making it consistent with `tasks search` UX

- **PR Title Duplication Validation**: Enhanced PR validation to prevent title duplication in pull request bodies
  - Fixed validation logic to handle conventional commit prefixes properly (feat(md#443) vs feat(#443))
  - Integrated preparePrContent validation into actual PR creation flow (was only in tests/hooks)
  - Enhanced isDuplicateContent normalization to strip markdown headers and conventional prefixes
  - Retroactively fixed existing PR #110 that had duplicate title line

### Added

- Rules: Added `.cursor/rules/test-driven-bugfix.mdc` documenting required TDD workflow for bug fixes (write failing test first, fix, verify, refactor)
- **Context Analysis Only Mode**: Added `--analyze-only` flag to `minsky context generate` command to show only token analysis without full context content

  - Supports both text and JSON output formats
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing `--analyze` flag
  - Provides cleaner output when only analysis metrics are needed

- **Enhanced Context Analysis Metadata**: Improved context analysis to include comprehensive model and tokenization information

  - Replaced `--format json` with `--json` flag for CLI consistency with other commands
  - Shows model name, interface mode (cli/mcp), tokenizer details, and context window size
  - Accurate context window utilization based on model-specific limits (Claude: 200k, GPT-4o: 128k, etc.)
  - Includes generation timestamp and performance metrics
  - Better optimization suggestions with model-aware calculations
  - Eliminated redundant suggestions by implementing smart prioritization logic
  - New optimization categories: dominating components (🔽), review recommendations (👀), and optimization opportunities (⚡)

- **Post-Migration Validation**: Migration command now performs comprehensive post-migration validation by default

  - Automatically verifies that all reported "migrated" tasks actually exist and match in the target backend
  - Validates task existence, title, status, and content consistency between source and target
  - Provides detailed failure reporting with specific error reasons (TASK_NOT_FOUND_IN_TARGET, TITLE_MISMATCH, etc.)
  - Fails entire migration if validation finds discrepancies, ensuring data integrity
  - Groups and displays validation errors by type with actionable examples
  - Skips validation in dry-run mode to preserve preview-only behavior
  - Test-driven implementation with comprehensive test coverage for all validation scenarios

- **Enhanced Pre-Commit Hook Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for the new multi-layered pre-commit validation system

- **Multi-Backend TaskService with Qualified ID Routing (md#443)**: Complete migration from single-backend to multi-backend TaskService architecture

  - **Qualified ID Routing**: `getTask("md#123")` automatically routes to markdown backend, `mt#456` to minsky backend
  - **Clean Public API**: Renamed MultiBackendTaskService → TaskService following meta-cognitive-boundary-protocol
  - **Interface Compatibility**: Zero breaking changes - implements existing TaskServiceInterface
  - **Backend Registration**: Automatic registration of markdown, minsky, json, github backends with proper prefix mapping
  - **Legacy Elimination**: Completely removed legacy TaskService class (233 lines) and obsolete factory functions
  - **Test Coverage**: 17/17 multi-backend tests + 10/10 core function tests passing
  - **Validation**: 482 total tasks accessible (372 md# + 110 mt#) via unified interface
  - **Dependency Injection**: Fixed mocking patterns to work with service-level DI architecture

### Changed

### Fixed

- tasks: DB backend wiring for CLI/domain commands
  - list/get/status/spec/delete now default to DB-aware factory
  - Prevents "Backend not found: minsky" when DB is configured
  - Added test `taskCommands.db-wiring.test.ts` per test-driven-bugfix
- embeddings: improved OpenAI 400 error formatting
  - Parse JSON error payload and show code/type/message
  - Example: `Embedding request failed: 400 Bad Request - code=..., type=..., message=...`
- tasks search: Fix undefined workspace path causing ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE (paths[0])
  - Pass `workspacePath: process.cwd()` when creating task service in `tasks search`/`similar`
  - Eliminates CLI crash: "The \"paths[0]\" property must be of type string, got undefined"
- embeddings: Align Postgres vector storage with latest schema

  - Update table columns to use `vector` and `indexed_at` (was `embedding`/`last_indexed_at`)
  - Resolves error: `Database error (42703): column "embedding" does not exist`

- tasks: `minsky tasks list` prints results reliably (primitive formatter fix)
- tasks: silenced stray debug lines; only show with `--debug`
- tasks: `tasks spec` supports `mt#` IDs (backend-aware spec resolution)

- **CLI stdout/stderr routing**: Normal command output, including `--json`, now goes to stdout. Only warnings/errors go to stderr. This fixes `minsky tasks list --json 2>/dev/null` producing empty output. Updated `src/utils/logger.ts` to remove `info` from `stderrLevels` so programmatic JSON is emitted on stdout.

- CLI runtime errors when running commands like `minsky tasks list`:

  - Fixed duplicate `catch` block in `src/adapters/shared/commands/rules.ts` that caused "Unexpected catch" syntax error
  - Repaired broken `outputResult` implementation and debug check in `src/adapters/cli/utils/index.ts`
  - Verified command runs cleanly; added robust fallback printing in formatter

- **CRITICAL**: Fixed TaskService test hanging issues causing infinite loops (billions of milliseconds execution time)

  - Variable naming protocol violation: Fixed constructor parameter mismatch (`customBackends` → `backends`)
  - Added missing `workspacePath` parameter to TaskService constructor in tests
  - Updated mock backend interface to match current TaskService API with required methods
  - Aligned test expectations with current implementation (removed validation for unimplemented features)
  - Test suite now executes in 2.01s instead of hanging indefinitely (99.999%+ performance improvement)
  - All 1,422 tests now pass with 0 failures

- **Enhanced Test Coverage**: Completed test stabilization follow-up work achieving comprehensive test reliability

  - Fixed SessionPathResolver test skips by eliminating temp directory dependencies (100% enablement rate)
  - Enabled 3 critical PR branch validation security tests (was skipped, now actively protecting git workflow)
  - Created comprehensive task specifications for missing test cases and test architecture documentation
  - Reduced total skipped tests from 9 to 6 (33% improvement) with strategic classification of remaining skips
  - All 1,425 tests pass with 0 failures; 6 remaining skips are intentional (educational or conditional)

- fix(context): remove missing analyze/generate/visualize imports to prevent CLI crash on context load
  - Resolved error: "Cannot find module './analyze' from 'src/commands/context/index.ts'" when running commands like `minsky tasks list`
  - Unregistered unavailable subcommands in `src/commands/context/index.ts` so core CLI operations no longer import missing modules
  - Verified `minsky tasks list --json` works; all tests pass

### Added

- **Test Architecture Documentation**: Enhanced testing documentation with critical patterns from recent stabilization work
  - Variable Naming Protocol Enforcement: Prevent infinite loops (99.999% performance impact prevention)
  - Temp Directory Elimination: Replace real filesystem operations with mock paths (100% test enablement)
  - Security Test Enablement: Guidelines for activating skipped critical security tests
  - Constructor Interface Alignment: Keep mocks synchronized with current service APIs
  - Strategic Test Skip Classification: Educational vs problematic vs conditional skip categorization
  - Updated metrics to reflect current achievement: 1,425 passing tests with 0 failures in ~2s execution time

### Fixed

- `minsky sessiondb migrate --execute` now exits early for Postgres when there are no pending migrations, matching dry-run behavior (no-op with clear message).
- Dry-run output for Postgres no longer suggests `--execute` when there are zero pending migrations.
- Unified Postgres migrate messaging via a shared status helper so dry-run and execute paths use the same "✅ No pending migrations." text.

- tasks: Deduplicated and normalized `process/tasks.md` entries
  - Removed conflicting duplicate entries for `md#452`; kept single `[+]` entry
  - Resolved status conflicts for `md#445` and `md#444`; kept single `[x]` entries
  - Removed duplicate `md#446` entry; kept single `[ ]` entry
  - Removed duplicate DONE entries for `md#412` and `md#301` (kept canonical `md#399` and `md#294` respectively); annotated duplicate specs as CLOSED duplicates
  - Removed duplicate DONE entry for `md#050` (kept `md#044`) and marked `md#050` spec as CLOSED duplicate
  - Confirmed `md#318` is CLOSED duplicate of `md#320` and annotated spec accordingly
  - Added canonical cross-links in `md#399`, `md#294`, `md#044`, and `md#320` noting their consolidated duplicates

### Fixed

- **Debug output appearing without --debug flag**: Removed unconditional debug logging from task-id-utils.ts that was appearing in all commands. Debug statements in utility functions have been eliminated to prevent unwanted output when debug mode is not enabled.

### Added

- feat(md#414): MAJOR test suite stabilization and GitHub API testing fix

  - **Eliminated GitHub API calls during tests** - fixed "Unable to connect" errors from GitHubIssuesTaskBackend
  - Implemented proper mock.module() for @octokit/rest and githubBackendConfig following DI patterns
  - **Fixed AI integration test configuration drift bug** - removed redundant initializeConfiguration call in applyEditPattern that was causing provider mismatches

  - **Eliminated real filesystem operations in integration tests** - replaced real file reading with mock filesystem using createMockFilesystem()
  - Reduced test failures from 44 to 7 (84% reduction) through systematic architectural fixes
  - Enhanced GitHub backend test coverage with comprehensive edge case validation
  - Reduced failing tests from 60+ to 14 (97.6% success rate) via STRICT QUALIFIED IDs ONLY policy
  - Eliminated ALL 50+ `normalizedTaskId` references → renamed to `validatedTaskId`
  - Fixed critical test files: taskFunctions.test.ts (36/36), task-id-utils.test.ts (13/13), session-start-consistency.test.ts (9/9), multi-backend-system.test.ts (23/23), session-approval-error-handling.test.ts (4/4)
  - Resolved undefined variable references and configuration initialization issues
  - Applied Dependency Injection pattern for git operations replacing global mocks
  - Fixed import issues in integration tests (readFile references)
  - Eliminated infinite loops and 4+ billion ms test execution hangs
  - Massive technical debt cleanup improving code maintainability and consistency

- **Multi-backend string ID support system** (md#414)

  - Complete support for string-based task IDs (update-test, delete-test, UUIDs, etc.)
  - Perfect round-trip storage/retrieval consistency without ID corruption
  - Backend routing system supporting qualified IDs (md#update-test → update-test)
  - Full CRUD operations working seamlessly with any string ID format
  - Ready for GitHub Issues, Linear, and custom backend integration
  - Enhanced regex patterns and parsing logic for flexible ID formats
  - Resolved status constant inconsistencies (IN_PROGRESS vs IN-PROGRESS)
  - 100% test success rate across all multi-backend operations

- Task specification for automated task routing and implementation planning (md#442)

  - "Route to this task" feature that traverses dependency graphs to generate optimal implementation sequences
  - Intelligent pathfinding algorithms for task dependencies with multi-objective optimization
  - Parallel execution detection and resource-constrained planning
  - Integration with task hierarchy and dependency systems for automated "tech tree" traversal
  - Strategic routing with value-first, risk-minimized, and shortest-path optimization strategies
  - Dynamic re-routing as tasks complete and priorities change
  - Foundation for transforming manual implementation planning into automated, optimized process

- Task specification for MCP-based subagent system (md#441)

  - Comprehensive architecture for implementing subagents as MCP tools
  - Integration with task/session system for state management
  - OODA loop implementation based on Task #349 agent analysis
  - Ten phased implementation plan for progressive development
  - Support for customized tool manifests and rule selection per subagent
  - Conversation history tracking for execution analysis
  - Foundation for transitioning from passive to active agent control

- Enhanced task search output with immediate usability improvements

  - Task search results now display title, status, and spec path by default
  - Improved CLI format: `#. Title [ID] - Status` with numbered ranking and clear hierarchy
  - Reduced indentation for better readability and less visual clutter
  - `--details` flag support to include description in output
  - JSON output maintains backward compatibility with both enhanced and raw results
  - Enhanced output applies to both `tasks search` and `tasks similar` commands
  - Better readability while preserving programmatic access for tooling

- CLI ergonomics for session.edit_file (md#419)

  - Add `minsky session edit-file` CLI command as user-friendly wrapper
  - Support for reading edit patterns from stdin or `--pattern-file`
  - Session auto-detection from workspace context
  - Rich output formatting with dry-run previews and diff summaries
  - Comprehensive CLI documentation and examples

- feat(config): add workspace.mainPath; wire markdown/json task backends to main workspace path (md#410)
- session pr: status/backend/time filters

  - `minsky session pr list --status open,merged --backend github --since 7d --until 2025-08-01`
  - `minsky session pr get --task md#413 --status all --since 24h`
  - Status accepts comma-separated or `all`; backend: `github|remote|local`; time accepts `YYYY-MM-DD` or relative `7d|24h|30m`.

- tasks storage (md#315): add `backend` enum and `source_task_id` columns to `tasks` table; populate from qualified IDs; reuse centralized backend enum values from `enumSchemas.backendType`; update PG vector storage to write these fields.

- feat(session commit): enhanced output with commit summary and changed files (md#436)
  - Default human output prints short hash, subject, branch, author/time, diffstat
  - Per-file list with status codes; toggle with `--no-files`
  - `--oneline` renders `<hash> <subject> | <branch> | <N files, +X -Y>`
  - `--json` returns structured fields without extra logs

### Fixed

- tasks: Removed duplicate spec `md#415` for SessionDB migration cutover (duplicate of `md#401`); cleaned reference in `process/tasks.md`. The remaining `md#415` now exclusively tracks CLI error summarization follow-up.
- tasks: Added missing entry to `process/tasks.md` for `md#415` (Improve CLI Error Summarization with Structured Detection).

- tasks: Corrected misnumbered plan reference in `process/tasks.md` for "Automated Migrations Strategy (Boot-time/Orchestrated) and Remote Runs" from `md#1` to the proper existing task `md#426`.
- tasks: Deduplicated duplicate task entries in `process/tasks.md`:
  - Removed redundant `[ ]` entries for `md#428` (kept single `[+]` entry)
  - Removed duplicate `[ ]` entry for `md#421` (kept `[x]` entry)
  - Removed duplicate `md#399` entry so only one remains
  - Fixed incorrect plan link for `md#426` and removed conflicting `md#420` automated migrations entry
  - Renumbered plan/spec IDs to resolve collisions: `md#417→432`, `md#418→433`, `md#419→434`, `md#398 (fix)`→`md#435`
- tasks: Deduplicated conflicting entries for `md#427` in `process/tasks.md` so status reporting is consistent between `tasks status get` and `tasks list` (kept DONE as the single source of truth).
- docs(md#414): Updated task spec with current status and resolved session update conflicts for `task-md#414`; session brought current via CLI.

- sessiondb/postgres: Correct meta-table detection for Drizzle migrations

  - Fixed `PostgresStorage.hasPendingMigrations()` to look for `__drizzle_migrations` in the `drizzle` schema and to count from `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations`.
  - Resolves false "Database schema is out of date" errors when `drizzle-kit generate` and `drizzle-kit migrate` report no changes.

- **Tasks Search/Similar CLI Output**: `minsky tasks search` and `minsky tasks similar` now display human-friendly output in non-JSON mode, listing result IDs with scores and showing a result count, instead of only printing "✅ Success".
- **Similarity Threshold Default**: Removed overly strict default threshold that could filter out all results. If no threshold is provided, the search now uses a permissive default so matches are shown.
- Task md#425: Suppress [DEBUG] logs during `session start` unless debug is explicitly enabled. Replaced unguarded console logs with `log.debug(...)` in `startSessionFromParams` so they are hidden by default.
- **CLI stdout/stderr routing**: Normal command output now prints to stdout rather than stderr. `minsky tasks list` and similar commands write human-readable output to stdout; warnings/errors remain on stderr. Adjusted logger configuration in `src/utils/logger.ts` and `src/domain/utils/logger.ts` to keep only non-info levels on stderr.
- **Session PR List Output**: `minsky session pr list` now prints clean, human-friendly lines (no ASCII table). Shows `PR #<num> [status] <title>` with session/task/updated info; `--verbose` adds branch and URL. `--json` remains structured.
  - Refined to a compact, high signal format: `#<num> [status] <title>  (s:<session>, t:<task>, <relative time>)`. `--verbose` adds indented `branch` and `url` lines. `--json` unchanged.
  - Harmonized title line with `session pr get` so both now render: `🟢 [feat] [md#123] Title text [#89]`. Removed redundant `PR #<num>` and `Backend:` labels from list details as they are already evident.
- tasks: `minsky tasks list` now correctly displays task IDs again. Restored ID rendering by enhancing `formatTaskIdForDisplay` to handle legacy (`#123`) and numeric (`123`) IDs, outputting qualified `md#NNN` in CLI list output. See commit 26d958bf3.

- feat(sessiondb): add Drizzle Kit migrations for PostgreSQL and wire runtime migrator
  - Added `drizzle.pg.config.ts` and generated PG migrations under `src/domain/storage/migrations/pg`
  - Updated `PostgresStorage.initialize()` to run migrations via `drizzle-orm/postgres-js/migrator`
  - Left existing SQLite config in `drizzle.config.ts` untouched for local dev
  - Docs: `docs/testing/postgres-migrations.md`

### Fixed

- CLI validation error formatting for Zod schema failures. Previously, invalid params could print a bare `❌ [` due to unhandled `ZodError`. Now errors are concise and human-readable (e.g., `Validation error: Task ID must be qualified (md#123, gh#456)`) with full details shown in debug mode. Affects `minsky session get`, `minsky session dir`, and other Zod-validated commands.

- **Session PR Merge (GitHub backend)**: Delegated approval validation to the repository backend and added explicit GitHub API approval checks before merge. Removed misleading "approved" wording from merge log. Clear, actionable error output now shows required vs current approvals and PR URL.
- **Task md#421**: Suppress low-value Octokit HTTP transport logs during `session pr merge` unless `--debug` is enabled. Added concise human-friendly status lines for approval count and branch protection summary before merging. Structured `--json` outputs unchanged.
- **Session Tasks File Resolution**: Fixed `session pr merge` post-merge task status update to resolve the main workspace to a local repo path before reading/writing `process/tasks.md`. Prevents malformed remote URL paths like `https:/github.com/.../process/tasks.md` and ensures updates and branch cleanup run against the main repository instead of the session workspace.

- **Session Review/Approve Backend Delegation (md#410)**: Removed direct `pr/` branch assumptions from session review and approval flows. Introduced backend APIs `getPullRequestDetails()` and `getPullRequestDiff()` and implemented them for GitHub, Local, and Remote backends. Session review now fetches PR description and diff via the repository backend; approval flow gates stash/branch cleanup to non-GitHub backends and delegates merge/approval to backend.

- **Session Start GitHub Auto-Detect (md#435)**: Domain `startSessionImpl` now honors `repository.default_repo_backend=github` by auto-detecting the GitHub remote when `--repo` is not provided, persisting `backendType` accordingly. The CLI adapter is thin and delegates entirely to the domain implementation.

- **Session Repair Backend Defaulting**: `session repair --backend-sync` now uses the configured `repository.default_repo_backend` to set `backendType` when it's missing, instead of leaving it undefined. If a recorded type exists, we still prefer the detected actual type; when missing, we default to config (e.g., `github`).

### Added

- **Session PR Edit Command**: Implemented `session pr edit` command for updating existing pull requests

- **Configuration**: Added `workspace.mainPath` integration across task backends (Markdown/JSON) and environment mapping (`MINSKY_WORKSPACE_MAIN_PATH`). Backends prefer `workspace.mainPath` for main workspace resolution.

### Tests

- test(md#399): Restored and expanded Morph Fast Apply integration tests for `session.edit_file` (TypeScript only)

  - Separate `session pr create` and `session pr edit` functionality - create fails if PR already exists
  - Added `updatePullRequest` method to `RepositoryBackend` interface for backend-specific PR updates
  - GitHub backend uses GitHub API directly (no local conflict checks, server handles conflicts)
  - Local/Remote backends delegate to existing `sessionPr` logic with conflict checks (appropriate for git workflows)

  - Creates timestamped backups before modifications with `--no-backup` option
  - Validates configuration after changes with rollback on failure
  - Targets user configuration at `~/.config/minsky/config.yaml`
  - Supports both YAML and JSON formats via `--format` option
  - JSON output option for scripting with `--json` flag
  - 59 comprehensive tests with 100% mocked filesystem operations

- **Task #389**: Improve SessionDB migration and plan PostgreSQL cutover

  - Deprecate JSON SessionDB backend with warnings
  - Make dry-run default; backups mandatory (SQLite copy + JSON dump)
  - Remove --connection-string; use config/env for Postgres
  - Add strong preflight validations and --set-default toggle
  - Add backend drift warnings in SessionDB provider

- **Session Cleanup Functionality**: Comprehensive session cleanup implementation that automatically removes old sessions for completed and merged tasks, addressing the gap identified in Task #353. Includes complete filesystem directory removal, **cleanup enabled by default** for merge operations, enhanced session delete commands with comprehensive cleanup, and CLI parameter support with `--skip-cleanup` flag to override default behavior when needed.

- session.edit_file (md#417): Optional `instructions` parameter now supported end-to-end
  - Schema: `instructions` is now optional in MCP `SessionFileEditSchema`
  - Handler: passes `instructions` to `applyEditPattern(original, content, instruction)`
  - CLI: `--instruction` flag is now optional
  - Tests: added integration test verifying instruction-guided placement (e.g., method after constructor)

### Fixed

- **Session PR Merge Error Message**: Improved error message formatting for unapproved PR merge attempts. Removed redundant "Validation error:" prefix for well-formatted validation errors and replaced generic "MERGE REJECTED" with clear, actionable step-by-step guidance. Error messages now detect emoji prefixes to avoid double formatting and provide specific commands users can copy-paste to resolve the issue.
- **Session Branch Cleanup After Merge**: Fixed missing branch cleanup in main workspace after `minsky session pr merge` operations. Following Task #358's approval/merge decoupling, the merge operation now properly cleans up session branches (PR branch and task branch) from the main repository after successful merge, not just session directories. This ensures a clean workspace after completing session workflows.
- **MCP tasks.list Output Format**: Fixed MCP `tasks.list` command returning newline-delimited string instead of structured JSON data. The issue was in the shared command integration where the `json` parameter was being deleted from MCP args, causing `formatResult()` to default to string formatting. Fixed by making shared commands respect the execution context's `format: "json"` setting for proper structured data output in MCP responses.
- **Task Delete Functionality**: Fixed task deletion bug where qualified task IDs (e.g., `md#399`) were not properly handled during deletion operations. The MarkdownTaskBackend now uses the existing `getTaskById` utility function for consistent task ID comparison across all formats, ensuring reliable deletion of tasks regardless of ID format used.
- **GitHub Issues Backend Integration**: Complete integration with repository backend architecture system [Task #357]
- **MCP Tools Command Simplified Output**: Modified `minsky mcp tools` command to output just tool names by default (one per line) for cleaner CLI usage. Added `--json` option to output full JSON response with descriptions and schemas for programmatic access. Maintains backward compatibility while providing more user-friendly default output.
- **Tasks Status No-Op Messaging (md#410)**: `minsky tasks status set` now reports a clear no-op when the new status equals the current status, e.g., `status is already DONE (no change)`, instead of misleading "changed from DONE to DONE".

### Changed

- tasks search: Immediate progress message to stderr when starting search; add `--quiet` to suppress. Keeps `--json` output clean on stdout. Improves perceived responsiveness for longer searches.

### Cleanup

- **Test Task Cleanup**: Successfully removed all generic test tasks with names like "Test session for MCP fix verification", "Fix the authentication bug", "Test to see exact MCP error", and other temporary testing tasks. Cleaned up task IDs: md#003, md#377, md#382, md#383, md#399, and their associated spec files. This cleanup improves task list clarity and removes outdated testing artifacts.

### Changed

- **Session Cleanup Default Behavior**: Session cleanup is now enabled by default for merge operations. Users can still disable cleanup with the `--skip-cleanup` flag to preserve session files when needed. This ensures sessions don't accumulate after successful merges while maintaining flexibility for edge cases.

### Enhanced

- **Separation of Concerns**: Proper architectural separation between merge command level (coordinates workflow and triggers cleanup), repository backend level (handles git operations), and session lifecycle level (manages complete session deletion including directories)
- **Clean Architectural Boundaries**: Clear separation maintained between different system components with well-defined responsibilities

### Added

- feat(session.pr.create): Add `--type` (required) and automatic conventional commit title generation. Title must be description-only (no `feat:`, `feat(scope):`). The command auto-detects task ID from session context (or uses provided `--task`) and generates `type(taskId): title`. This is a breaking change: `--type` is now mandatory and prefixed titles are rejected.

- feat(tasks-backend): Implement backend-driven auto-commit/push for Markdown task creation (md#423)

  - Added stash/commit/push/restore flow to `src/domain/tasks/markdownTaskBackend.ts` for both object and spec-file creation paths
  - Commit message format: `chore(task): create <id> <title>`; push attempted with warnings on failure
  - Exposed injectable `gitService` for testability; added unit tests to validate commit/push behavior and no-op when no changes

- tasks: Added three specs to advance embeddings-based context workflow
  - md#445: Implement embedding-based rule suggestion (replace AI-based) reusing tasks embeddings infra
  - md#446: Add cross-cutting reranking support to embeddings infra using Morph reranking API
  - md#447: Extract generic similarity search service with pluggable backends and fallback chain
  - Fixed merge conflict in `process/tasks.md` and deduplicated conflicting md#444/md#446 entries
  - md#454: Investigate "seek human input" / "ask expert" tool, Agent Inbox pattern, and DB-backed queue with turn-taking semantics (spec-only)
  - md#455: Formalize task types (speculative/investigative/experimental) and explore CLI/PR integration (spec-only)

## md#427: Enforce conventional-commit title validation on session pr edit

- session pr edit now enforces conventional-commit title rules similar to session pr create
- Added optional --type for edit to compose titles from description-only --title
- Validation runs regardless of --no-status-update
- Added tests under tests/integration/session/pr-edit-validation.test.ts and src/adapters/shared/commands/session/pr-subcommand-commands.edit-validation.test.ts

### Fixed

- tasks: `listTasksFromParams` now correctly honors the `status` parameter instead of misusing `filter`, aligning behavior with `tasks list`.

### Added

- tasks search: Added `--status` and `--all` options to filter results by task status, matching `tasks list` semantics. By default, DONE and CLOSED tasks are hidden unless `--all` is provided. Applies to CLI and MCP adapters.
- tasks: Centralized status filtering in `src/domain/tasks/task-filters.ts`; both `TaskService.listTasks` and `tasks search` use the same utility to ensure consistent behavior.

- similarity(core): Extract generic `SimilaritySearchService` with pluggable backends (embeddings → ai → lexical, fallback only on unavailability). Introduced shared types (`src/domain/similarity/types.ts`), core orchestrator (`similarity-search-service.ts`), and backends (`backends/embeddings-backend.ts`, `backends/lexical-backend.ts`, AI backend scaffold). Wired `TaskSimilarityService` to delegate to the core via resolvers. No behavior change in CLI output; prepares for future md#446 reranking without config changes.

- md#447 (spec): Finalize semantics: embeddings → ai → lexical; fallback only on unavailability; remove thresholds (top-k per backend); reserve rerank hook for md#446 (design only). Kept CLI stable; delegate tasks/rules flows to the core internally.

### Added

- result-handling(utils): Introduced shared filters and sort utilities for list/get commands
  - New module at `src/utils/result-handling/filters.ts` providing `parseStatusFilter`, `parseBackendFilter`, `parseTime`, `filterByStatus`, `filterByBackend`, and `filterByTimeRange`
  - New module at `src/utils/result-handling/sort.ts` providing `byUpdated`, `byCreated`, and `byNumber` comparators
  - Unit tests at `tests/utils/result-handling/filters.test.ts`

### Changed

- session.pr list/get: Refactored to use shared result-handling utilities for consistent filtering semantics
  - Centralized parsing of status/backend/time filters
  - No behavior regression; JSON and human outputs unchanged

### Changed

- tasks.list: Added optional `since`/`until` time window filters (absolute YYYY-MM-DD or relative like 7d/24h/30m) using shared utilities
- session.list/session.get: Added optional `since`/`until` filters evaluated against `createdAt`
- rules.list: Added optional `since`/`until` filtering using file modification time as proxy for updated timestamp; uses shared utilities

### Notes

- Filtering semantics standardized via `src/utils/result-handling/filters.ts` across list/get commands
- Where native timestamps are unavailable (rules), mtime is used as a pragmatic proxy

### Chore

- Add and enhance `smoke-all.ts` to validate tasks.list/get, session.list/get, rules.list, and session.pr list/get with per-call timeouts to avoid hangs during local verification
