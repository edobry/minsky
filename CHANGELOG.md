# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Major Completion**: Full migration of `session-approve.test.ts` to centralized factory pattern
  - Successfully migrated all 9 tests to use `createMockSessionProvider()`, `createMockGitService()`, `createMockTaskService()`
  - Established comprehensive spy integration pattern for call tracking
  - Fixed systematic interface property naming: `_session` â†’ `session` throughout all tests
  - All 10 tests passing (49 expect() calls) with verified functionality

### Changed  
- **Code Reduction**: Eliminated ~100+ lines of duplicate mock object declarations in `session-approve.test.ts`
- **Jest Pattern Elimination**: Removed all local mock object patterns in favor of centralized factories
- **Interface Standardization**: Applied consistent property naming fixes across all test methods
- **Test Architecture**: Established reusable pattern for spy integration with centralized factories

### Fixed
- Test assertion for git branch reference check (refs/remotes/ vs refs/heads/)
- Interface mismatches causing TypeScript warnings in centralized factory usage
- Call tracking verification using individual spy methods instead of direct mock references

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: `src/domain/session-approve.test.ts`, task specification documentation
- **Pattern Established**: Individual spy creation + centralized factory integration + interface fixes
- **Test Status**: All 10 tests passing, 49 expect() calls verified
- **Impact**: Phase 1 critical refactoring targets now complete (3/3 files)

This completes the largest and most complex test file migration in the centralized factory pattern initiative, demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of the established approach.
