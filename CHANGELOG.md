# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Task #061 - PHASE 1 COMPLETE**: Successfully migrated all critical test files from Jest patterns to centralized Bun test factory patterns
  - **Completed files**: `session-git-clone-bug-regression.test.ts`, `git-pr-workflow.test.ts`, `session-approve.test.ts` (3/3 Phase 1 targets)
  - **Pattern established**: Comprehensive Jest → Bun migration with centralized factories (`createMockSessionProvider`, `createMockGitService`, `createMockTaskService`)
  - **Interface standardization**: Systematic naming fixes (`_session` → `session`, `_title` → `title`, `_status` → `status`) applied across complex scenarios
  - **Code reduction**: ~160+ lines of duplicate mock code eliminated across all completed files
  - **Test reliability**: All 22 migrated tests passing (101+ expect() calls) with significantly improved maintainability
  - **Scalability validation**: Successfully handled complex test scenarios from simple 2-test files to 10-test files with intricate mocking requirements
  - **Migration methodology**: Proven systematic approach ready for Phase 2 application to remaining Jest-pattern violations

- **Task #286**: Added complete HTTP transport support for MCP server

### Changed  
- **Code Reduction**: Eliminated ~100+ lines of duplicate mock object declarations in `session-approve.test.ts`
- **Jest Pattern Elimination**: Removed all local mock object patterns in favor of centralized factories
- **Interface Standardization**: Applied consistent property naming fixes across all test methods
- **Test Architecture**: Established reusable pattern for spy integration with centralized factories

### Fixed
- Test assertion for git branch reference check (refs/remotes/ vs refs/heads/)
- Interface mismatches causing TypeScript warnings in centralized factory usage
- Call tracking verification using individual spy methods instead of direct mock references

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: `src/domain/session-approve.test.ts`, task specification documentation
- **Pattern Established**: Individual spy creation + centralized factory integration + interface fixes
- **Test Status**: All 10 tests passing, 49 expect() calls verified
- **Impact**: Phase 1 critical refactoring targets now complete (3/3 files)

This completes the largest and most complex test file migration in the centralized factory pattern initiative, demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of the established approach.
