# fix: Move all test files from **tests** directories to co-located positions

## Summary

Fixed all 13 ESLint violations of the `no-tests-directories` rule by moving test files from `__tests__` directories to be co-located with their modules, following Task #270's test architecture improvements. Additionally resolved a critical session PR validation bug that was preventing PR creation via MCP interface.

## Changes

### Test File Organization (15 files moved)

**Domain Layer:**

- Moved `src/domain/__tests__/git-pr-workflow.test.ts` → `src/domain/git-service-pr-workflow.test.ts`
- Preserved original as `src/domain/session-approve-workflow.test.ts` (different functionality)
- Moved `src/domain/__tests__/tasks.test.ts` → `src/domain/tasks-core-functions.test.ts`
- Preserved original as `src/domain/tasks-interface-commands.test.ts` (different functionality)
- Moved `src/domain/__tests__/git-service.test.ts` → `src/domain/git-service.test.ts`
- Moved all `src/domain/git/commands/__tests__/*.test.ts` → `src/domain/git/commands/*.test.ts` (3 files)
- Moved `src/domain/session/__tests__/session-pr-body-validation.test.ts` → `src/domain/session/session-pr-body-validation.test.ts`

**Adapters & Utils:**

- Moved `src/adapters/__tests__/session-context-resolver.test.ts` → `src/adapters/session-context-resolver.test.ts`
- Moved `src/adapters/shared/commands/__tests__/session-context-resolution.test.ts` → `src/adapters/shared/commands/session-context-resolution.test.ts`
- Moved all `src/utils/__tests__/*.test.ts` → `src/utils/*.test.ts` (4 files)

**Infrastructure:**

- Removed 6 empty `__tests__` directories
- All ESLint `no-tests-directories` violations resolved (13 → 0)

### Documentation Improvements

Added comprehensive documentation headers to all moved test files explaining:

- **What each file tests** - Clear explanation of functionality covered
- **Key test categories** - Breakdown of major test areas
- **Relationship to other tests** - Notes comparing to similar test files
- **Specific focus areas** - Details on business logic, integration, etc.

### Critical Bug Fix: Session PR Validation

**Problem:** `createCloneOperation is not defined` error when using MCP session PR command

**Root Cause:** Outdated workspace validation logic in `sessionPrFromParams` that checked current working directory instead of using provided session parameters

**Solution:**

- Removed outdated current directory workspace detection logic
- Updated to use required `sessionName` parameter from CLI/MCP interfaces
- Added proper session workspace directory resolution via `getSessionWorkdir()`
- Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and type safety issues

**Impact:** Session PR command now works properly with MCP interface without validation errors

## Testing

### ESLint Rule Verification

```bash
# Before: 13 violations
npx eslint . | grep "no-tests-directories" | wc -l
# Result: 13

# After: 0 violations
npx eslint . | grep "no-tests-directories" | wc -l
# Result: 0
```

### File Organization Verification

- All test files successfully moved to co-located positions
- No test functionality lost - files with different purposes preserved separately
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Enhanced documentation prevents future confusion

### Session PR Bug Fix Verification

- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in `src/domain/session.ts`
- Resolved ZodError typing issues with proper type assertions
- Added null safety for session workspace directory resolution
- All linter errors resolved (Prettier, ESLint)

## Breaking Changes

None. All changes are organizational improvements and bug fixes that maintain existing functionality.

## Notes

### File Conflict Resolution

During the move process, discovered that some files in `__tests__` directories were testing different functionality than existing co-located files:

- `git-pr-workflow.test.ts`: Split into `session-approve-workflow.test.ts` (session approval) and `git-service-pr-workflow.test.ts` (GitService PR functionality)
- `tasks.test.ts`: Split into `tasks-interface-commands.test.ts` (command layer) and `tasks-core-functions.test.ts` (domain logic)

This preserves all test coverage while improving organization and clarity.

### Architecture Insight

The session PR validation fix highlights the evolution from workspace-detection patterns to explicit parameter passing. Modern session domain methods require explicit `sessionName` parameters that CLI/MCP interfaces provide, eliminating the need for directory-based validation inside domain methods.
