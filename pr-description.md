# fix(session): decouple session approve from session workspace state

Fixes #149

## Problem

The `session approve` command was failing when there were uncommitted changes in the session workspace because it tried to run git operations in the session workspace directory instead of the main repository.

**Error encountered:**

```
Command execution failed {"error":"Command failed: git checkout main\nerror: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:\n\tprocess/tasks.md\nPlease commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.\nAborting\n"}
```

## Root Cause

The `approveSessionFromParams` function in `src/domain/session.ts` was using `sessionWorkdir` (session workspace path) for all git operations instead of operating on the main repository (`originalRepoPath`).

## Solution

- **Decouple from session workspace**: Replace `sessionWorkdir` with `originalRepoPath` for all git operations in the approval flow
- **Add session auto-detection**: When only repo path is provided, automatically detect the current session
- **Fix dependency injection**: Properly use injected `sessionDB` in tests instead of creating new instances
- **Update tests**: Modify tests to reflect the correct behavior and verify all functionality

## Key Changes

### Core Fix (`src/domain/session.ts`)

- Line 1071: Changed `sessionWorkdir` to `originalRepoPath` for all git operations
- Lines 1041-1051: Added auto-detection logic for sessions when only repo path provided
- Line 1022: Fixed dependency injection to use provided `sessionDB`
- Line 1095: Improved error logging with proper CLI output

### Test Updates (`src/domain/__tests__/session-approve.test.ts`)

- Updated first test to not expect `getSessionWorkdir` call (no longer needed)
- Fixed second test to properly mock session detection for "current-session"
- Ensured all 5 session approval tests pass

## Impact

✅ **Session workspace state is now completely irrelevant during approval**
✅ **`session approve` works regardless of uncommitted changes, branch state, or conflicts in session workspace**
✅ **All existing functionality preserved** (task status updates, PR cleanup)
✅ **No regression in approval safety checks**
✅ **Comprehensive test coverage** (5/5 session approve tests pass)

## Testing

- All automated tests pass
- Specific session approve functionality verified with comprehensive test suite
- Manual verification of fix working with various session workspace states

## Verification

The fix addresses the core issue while maintaining all existing functionality:

1. **Before**: `session approve` failed with uncommitted changes in session workspace
2. **After**: `session approve` operates entirely on main repository, ignoring session workspace state
3. **Safety**: All existing validation and error handling preserved
4. **Compatibility**: No breaking changes to the approval API or workflow
